[10/31/19, 10:29:00 PM] Luc: Que!?
[10/31/19, 10:29:04 PM] Luc: Ufff
[10/31/19, 10:29:19 PM] Luc: Lo m√≠o es iyer :)
[10/31/19, 10:35:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Awesome
[10/31/19, 10:36:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Told you. No estoy casi nada en mi casa en la semana. üíî
[10/31/19, 10:36:44 PM] Luc: Ten√©s clases por la noche?
[10/31/19, 10:37:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. Trabajo hasta la tarde y de ah√≠ voy directo a clases.
[10/31/19, 10:37:37 PM] Luc: Un mes m√°s y te recib√≠s?
[10/31/19, 10:37:59 PM] Luc: Felicitaciones, ya te deber√≠a haber dicho
[10/31/19, 10:38:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: En un mes termino de ir a clases, en dos de dar los ex√°menes. Pero si, ya casi.
[10/31/19, 10:38:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Por?
‚Äé[10/31/19, 10:38:45 PM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[10/31/19, 10:38:56 PM] Luc: Por haberte casi* recibido
[10/31/19, 10:39:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ahhh jajaja, gracias! üòÅ
[10/31/19, 10:39:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: No te pregunt√© si estudias o estudiaste algo vos
[10/31/19, 10:39:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: O si y no lo estoy recordando?
[10/31/19, 10:41:27 PM] Luc: Creo que no
[10/31/19, 10:41:47 PM] Luc: Estudi√© econom√≠a matem√°tica
[10/31/19, 10:43:01 PM] Luc: Muy nerd no?
[10/31/19, 10:43:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja para nada
[10/31/19, 10:43:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Bah, si, pero no juzgo. Soy nerd asumida jajaja.
[10/31/19, 10:44:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ya tendr√°s oportunidad de explicarme mejor de qu√© va, porque no estoy muy segura jaja
[10/31/19, 10:44:54 PM] Luc: Dec√≠s, de que trata?
[10/31/19, 10:45:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Claro
[10/31/19, 10:45:50 PM] Luc: Hmm
[10/31/19, 10:46:11 PM] Luc: Nunca explique en espa√±ol
[10/31/19, 10:46:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Today is the day üòÅ
[10/31/19, 10:46:41 PM] Luc: Es analysis de datos, pero con el paradigma de varias aplicaciones
[10/31/19, 10:47:08 PM] Luc: Me enfoque en game theory y time series analysis
[10/31/19, 10:47:29 PM] Luc: Game theory es mucho m√°s teor√©tica
[10/31/19, 10:47:58 PM] Luc: Dise√±as reglas y incentivos y despu√©s calculas los outcomes
[10/31/19, 10:48:05 PM] Luc: Te ayuda modelar sistemas m√°s complicados
[10/31/19, 10:48:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ok. Estoy as√≠ ü§Ø
[10/31/19, 10:48:42 PM] Luc: Time series es una t√©cnica estad√≠stica que se usa para ver el efecto de cambios que persisten por un tiempo extendido
[10/31/19, 10:48:51 PM] Luc: I'm sorry I do a very bad job explaining
[10/31/19, 10:49:07 PM] Luc: Anything in econ is just an attempt to simplify the real world
[10/31/19, 10:49:20 PM] Luc: And I think it's fascinating but it's also sometimes very abstract
[10/31/19, 10:49:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: No, u don‚Äôt! I meant that I‚Äôm mindblown. It‚Äôs amazing. And amazingly difficult.
[10/31/19, 10:49:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[10/31/19, 10:50:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: (definitivamente muy nerd)
[10/31/19, 10:51:10 PM] Luc: Tiene m√°s sentido una vez que sepas las aplicaciones al mundo real
[10/31/19, 10:51:42 PM] Luc: Te digo mejor alguna vez en persona as√≠ no te aburro tanto esta noche
[10/31/19, 10:51:57 PM] Luc: Igual no tiene nada que ver con lo que hago
[10/31/19, 10:52:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Dale, me encant√≥.
[10/31/19, 10:53:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Lo qu√© haces ac√° lo conseguiste ac√° o ya viniste con trabajo desde US?
[10/31/19, 10:54:01 PM] Luc: Me renuncie de mi trabajo all√° y fui a viajar por casi 6 meses
[10/31/19, 10:55:04 PM] Luc: Fui solo con mi mochila a Lisboa y segu√≠ la costa mediterr√°nea hasta Albania, despu√©s cruzando Europa del este hasta Estambul
[10/31/19, 10:55:49 PM] Luc: Despu√©s pase un mes recorriendo Sri Lanka (incre√≠ble)
[10/31/19, 10:55:57 PM] Luc: Y me mud√© ac√°!
[10/31/19, 10:56:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: No dejas de sorprenderme
[10/31/19, 10:56:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja
[10/31/19, 10:57:11 PM] Luc: Super gran cambio pero estaba muy feliz, especialmente porque no tenia cosas, y cuando no tengo muchas cosas no tengo mucho estr√©s. Todav√≠a estoy feliz, no me arrepiento haber venido ac√°
[10/31/19, 10:57:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que gran decisi√≥n!
[10/31/19, 10:59:25 PM] Luc: La tome porque sabia que s√≠ hubiera esperado mas, nunca lo habr√≠a hecho
[10/31/19, 11:01:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Seguro!
[10/31/19, 11:02:02 PM] Luc: Y vos Ana, que pretendes hacer despu√©s de recibirte?
[10/31/19, 11:04:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: La verdad? No tengo idea.
[10/31/19, 11:04:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Una de las cosas que planeo es rendir el examen para ingresar a las Naciones Unidas.
[10/31/19, 11:05:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero de ah√≠ a que apruebe e ingrese, es otra cosa.
[10/31/19, 11:05:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Veremos para donde me lleva la vida jaja
[10/31/19, 11:05:42 PM] Luc: No sab√≠a que exist√≠a eso
[10/31/19, 11:05:50 PM] Luc: Para ser traductora?
[10/31/19, 11:05:56 PM] Luc: O es m√°s general
[10/31/19, 11:06:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Claro. Para ingresar en el departamento de idiomas. Podes rendir para traductor (y otros roles parecidos) o para int√©rprete.
[10/31/19, 11:07:19 PM] Luc: Me explicas la diferencia entre interpretar y traducir?
[10/31/19, 11:07:34 PM] Luc: Traducir refiere m√°s a la parte escrita?
[10/31/19, 11:11:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Esa es exactamente la diferencia
[10/31/19, 11:12:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: El int√©rprete es el traductor oral.
[10/31/19, 11:12:32 PM] Luc: M√°s dif√≠cil no? Tambi√©n m√°s divertida
[10/31/19, 11:12:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Siii. Me encanta.
[10/31/19, 11:12:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es pura adrenalina
[10/31/19, 11:13:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero tambi√©n me encuentro muy a gusto traduciendo tranquila, frente a la computadora. Al d√≠a de hoy no se cual me gusta m√°s. Por eso hice ambas cosas jaja.
[10/31/19, 11:13:46 PM] Luc: Y conseguis traducir castellano a ingl√©s al momento?
[10/31/19, 11:15:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: La verdad, no estoy muy activa en la b√∫squeda porque hasta no terminar la carrera no tengo momento. Pero si, surgen, principalmente de conocidos que necesitan.
[10/31/19, 11:15:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Trabajo como asistente biling√ºe en una empresa, pero no traduzco a diario.
[10/31/19, 11:15:51 PM] Luc: Ten√©s muchos amigos extranjeros?
[10/31/19, 11:16:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pocos. Pero me refer√≠a a gente de ac√° que necesita traducciones.
[10/31/19, 11:17:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Por ejemplo, hice varias para mi hermano que es publicista.
[10/31/19, 11:18:31 PM] Luc: Ahh
[10/31/19, 11:18:34 PM] Luc: Que bueno
[10/31/19, 11:19:01 PM] Luc: Y no perd√©s nada por no tener amigos extranjeros ac√°
[10/31/19, 11:19:38 PM] Luc: No le culpo a la Argentina, pero atrae dos tipos de extranjeros, me parece
[10/31/19, 11:20:35 PM] Luc: Un tipo que realmente cree que todo est√° incre√≠ble y andan solamente por Palermo y viven como reyes gastando una bocha
[10/31/19, 11:21:20 PM] Luc: Y el otro tipo que arranca cada oraci√≥n con "este √©s un pa√≠s de mierda, sabes que en los EEUU tenemos..."
[10/31/19, 11:21:53 PM] Luc: Y nadie habla espa√±ol, que me da verg√ºenza
[10/31/19, 11:22:20 PM] Luc: Bueno rant over
[10/31/19, 11:22:30 PM] Luc: Sorry üôÉ
[10/31/19, 11:26:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahah it‚Äôs ok
[10/31/19, 11:26:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: I guess you don‚Äôt fit in any of those categories, right?
[10/31/19, 11:27:09 PM] Luc: I fit in both! Just depends on the day üòâ
[10/31/19, 11:27:29 PM] Luc: Pero che hablo un poquito üòü
[10/31/19, 11:27:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja av√≠same cuando sea uno de esos d√≠as de vivir como reyes!
[10/31/19, 11:28:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Estudiaste antes? O fuiste aprendiendo ac√°? Hablas bien!
‚Äé[10/31/19, 11:28:45 PM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[10/31/19, 11:29:11 PM] Luc: Del ca√±o lo m√°s memeable de todos
[10/31/19, 11:29:41 PM] Luc: No, ni ac√° estudi√©
[10/31/19, 11:30:37 PM] Luc: Cuando laburaba con la empresa argentina me adoptaron y me ense√±aron un mont√≥n
[10/31/19, 11:31:18 PM] Luc: Gente incre√≠ble
[10/31/19, 11:35:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que bien!
[10/31/19, 11:54:25 PM] Luc: Aparte de tu ingl√©s excelente, hablas otros idiomas?
[11/1/19, 12:06:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja no tanto como excelente
[11/1/19, 12:06:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Si, franc√©s. Pero poco.
[11/1/19, 12:06:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Vos? Otros idiomas?
[11/1/19, 12:10:05 AM] Luc: Portugu√©s
[11/1/19, 12:15:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: Estudiaste o tambi√©n aprendiste de vivirlo?
[11/1/19, 12:17:49 AM] Luc: El √∫ltimo
[11/1/19, 12:20:59 AM] Luc: Estoy seguro que cuando hablas o escuchas ingl√©s, hay un cierto flujo que esperas, que escuchas? A lo que prestas atenci√≥n?
[11/1/19, 12:21:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: Que bien eso. Doblemente meritorio.
[11/1/19, 12:22:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: No entend√≠, como un flujo? ü§î
[11/1/19, 12:22:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Perd√≥n, a esta hora ya estoy low bat
[11/1/19, 12:22:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja
[11/1/19, 12:22:39 AM] Luc: Haha no es la mala mia, no me explico bien
[11/1/19, 12:23:10 AM] Luc: A veces hay oraciones, frases, lo que sea
[11/1/19, 12:23:37 AM] Luc: Que uno escucha y aunque no lo entiende, sabe si es correcto o no
[11/1/19, 12:23:46 AM] Luc: Entienda?
[11/1/19, 12:24:16 AM] Luc: Mi cerebro tambi√©n esta muerto
[11/1/19, 12:25:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja podemos pasar a ingl√©s si prefer√≠s. Haces doble trabajo sino.
[11/1/19, 12:25:22 AM] Luc: üôèüèºüôèüèº
[11/1/19, 12:25:29 AM] Luc: I'm sorry
[11/1/19, 12:25:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: No prob at all. Happy to do it.
[11/1/19, 12:26:08 AM] Luc: Early morning today and I actually had to do a full meeting in Portuguese for the first time in a few months and my brain is fried
[11/1/19, 12:27:13 AM] Luc: I just feel that each language has its personality, and once you clue into said personality, you start to feel it and reproduce it rather that to consciously construct it, as one does when they're first learning
[11/1/19, 12:27:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: And I made you speak Spanish all day long! How inconsiderate of me
[11/1/19, 12:27:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: I got you.
[11/1/19, 12:27:55 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yes, that‚Äôs a good way to put it.
[11/1/19, 12:29:40 AM] Luc: And you start speaking even without knowing which words you need to put together? But they sort of just come out? And occasionally they come out wrong but you _notice it_ because it just sounds a bit off?
[11/1/19, 12:29:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: It definitely works like that. Still, I believe that you indefinitely need to learn some grammar at some point. In order to understand the ‚Äúreasons‚Äù why you can use certain word or structure that you would not use in another language.
[11/1/19, 12:30:13 AM] Luc: Agreed 100%
[11/1/19, 12:30:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: I actually love when this happens.
[11/1/19, 12:31:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: I realized it trying to speak French (my very poor French) in France.
[11/1/19, 12:31:47 AM] Luc: Hahahah
[11/1/19, 12:31:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: It just flowed
[11/1/19, 12:32:10 AM] Luc: Are you better after a bit of wine? Or is this just a myth?
[11/1/19, 12:32:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: No myth at all
[11/1/19, 12:33:01 AM] Luc: ü•Ç
[11/1/19, 12:33:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/1/19, 12:33:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: We have two or three of those topics that you mentioned earlier pending.. right?
[11/1/19, 12:34:06 AM] Luc: Waaaay back
[11/1/19, 12:34:21 AM] Luc: Dealer's choice Anita
[11/1/19, 12:34:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha fair enough
[11/1/19, 12:35:22 AM] Luc: I said that and then immediately noticed it was confusing because I am the dealer? I guess? But you choose. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[11/1/19, 12:35:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaa
[11/1/19, 12:35:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah. I was waiting for you to choose.
[11/1/19, 12:35:53 AM] Luc: I like that you switch to laughing with H
[11/1/19, 12:35:57 AM] Luc: I appreciate these details
[11/1/19, 12:36:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt realized it until you said it
[11/1/19, 12:37:13 AM] Luc: I just can't do the jajaja, it feels and looks so wrong to me
[11/1/19, 12:37:23 AM] Luc: I don't mind when others do
[11/1/19, 12:37:40 AM] Luc: But I just can't!
[11/1/19, 12:37:51 AM] Luc: Anyway, *not* dealer's choice.
[11/1/19, 12:38:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: Even though I‚Äôm quite intrigued about the alien topic, I think I‚Äôll go with sex.
[11/1/19, 12:38:55 AM] Luc: Oh but aliens are so good
[11/1/19, 12:39:05 AM] Luc: Hm
[11/1/19, 12:39:37 AM] Luc: I picked four knowing that you would never choose to talk about sex right off the bat, I have no follow up question
[11/1/19, 12:39:54 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja
[11/1/19, 12:40:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: I usually wouldn‚Äôt, but I wanted to get out of my comfort zone this time
[11/1/19, 12:40:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: So aliens it is
[11/1/19, 12:40:34 AM] Luc: No takebacks
[11/1/19, 12:41:39 AM] Luc: What would you prefer, to never orgasm for the REST of your life, or or just have spontaneous orgasms at the worst times, like at the verduleria, at your mother's birthday party, while at church?
[11/1/19, 12:42:07 AM] Luc: This is such a wtf question
[11/1/19, 12:42:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/1/19, 12:42:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: It is
[11/1/19, 12:42:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: But I‚Äôd say never orgasm
[11/1/19, 12:42:45 AM] Luc: Hahaha what?!
[11/1/19, 12:42:55 AM] Luc: Unexpected
[11/1/19, 12:43:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: One can still have fun without getting there. But there‚Äôs no coming back from a spontaneous orgasm at the verduler√≠a
[11/1/19, 12:43:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: I mean. Awkward as fuck.
[11/1/19, 12:43:37 AM] Luc: To clarify, you can still orgasm normally but on top of that you just really get excited by your local verdulero boliviano
[11/1/19, 12:43:59 AM] Luc: I feel you'd get a discount next time
[11/1/19, 12:44:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/1/19, 12:44:14 AM] Luc: It's the birthdays and funerals that are worrisome
[11/1/19, 12:44:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Funerals more than anything
[11/1/19, 12:44:43 AM] Anita Zuddio: I mean. How could you explain that?
[11/1/19, 12:44:52 AM] Luc: Maybe you pass it off as crying? Moaning out of sadness? üôä
[11/1/19, 12:45:16 AM] Luc: There are ways, I imagine
[11/1/19, 12:45:44 AM] Luc: Then again I'm not a woman and I know that it's a very different sensation entirely
[11/1/19, 12:45:46 AM] Luc: So hey
[11/1/19, 12:45:48 AM] Luc: Fair enough
[11/1/19, 12:46:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha a whole new level of wtf
[11/1/19, 12:47:44 AM] Luc: We do what we must to survive
[11/1/19, 12:48:20 AM] Anita Zuddio: Do you mean having orgasms at funerals?
[11/1/19, 12:48:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not cool to talk about surviving in that context, Luc...
[11/1/19, 12:48:47 AM] Luc: Worse things have happened
‚Äé[11/1/19, 12:49:20 AM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/1/19, 12:49:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja
[11/1/19, 12:49:31 AM] Luc: Oh here's an uncomfortable one, ever heard your parents having sex or accidentally walked in on them?
[11/1/19, 12:50:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: (Whenever I use ‚Äúhahaha‚Äù and my dictionary is in Spanish, it automatically turns it into ‚Äújajaja‚Äù ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ)
[11/1/19, 12:50:57 AM] Anita Zuddio: Never. Luckily.
[11/1/19, 12:51:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: But my neighbors are quite loud. I guess that‚Äôs what I got. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/1/19, 12:51:32 AM] Luc: Don't worry I cycle between English/Spanish/Portuguese and occasionally weird things come out, lots of misplaced √± and √ß
[11/1/19, 12:51:46 AM] Luc: Hahahahahah
[11/1/19, 12:52:05 AM] Luc: Gotta start dropping uncomfortable hints
[11/1/19, 12:52:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: That would be fun
[11/1/19, 12:53:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: But we don‚Äôt get along. So I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs ever gonna happen haha.
[11/1/19, 12:53:39 AM] Luc: Do you live alone?
[11/1/19, 12:53:51 AM] Anita Zuddio: I do
[11/1/19, 12:54:02 AM] Luc: Ahh gotcha
[11/1/19, 12:54:04 AM] Luc: Good on you
[11/1/19, 12:54:12 AM] Luc: Not the most common thing in the world here
[11/1/19, 12:54:48 AM] Luc: Do you _like_ living alone?
[11/1/19, 12:55:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: Oh no. Rent is the problem. It is waaaaay to expensive for a regular wage.
[11/1/19, 12:55:49 AM] Luc: Try SF üò∂
[11/1/19, 12:56:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: I love it. Having my own place.
[11/1/19, 12:57:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: It was very difficult to adapt tho, I was used to a noisy house, always with someone around. Huge change.
[11/1/19, 12:57:55 AM] Luc: How long ago did you move out?
[11/1/19, 12:58:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: A bit more than a year ago.
[11/1/19, 12:58:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not that much.
[11/1/19, 12:58:57 AM] Luc: I think it takes a very particular type of person to live alone
[11/1/19, 12:59:06 AM] Luc: I'm glad you like it
[11/1/19, 12:59:14 AM] Luc: I do too mostly
[11/1/19, 12:59:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a compliment or the opposite haha
[11/1/19, 12:59:29 AM] Luc: I come home pretty exhausted and it's nice that it's quiet and exactly the way I left it
[11/1/19, 1:00:06 AM] Luc: Neither, just an extended segue
[11/1/19, 1:00:10 AM] Luc: üòõ
[11/1/19, 1:00:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Specially the last part
[11/1/19, 1:01:05 AM] Luc: I travel though and my plants die
[11/1/19, 1:01:13 AM] Luc: So that is one downside
[11/1/19, 1:02:30 AM] Luc: Anyway where were we
[11/1/19, 1:02:43 AM] Luc: I was trying to come up with questions to make you uncomfortable
[11/1/19, 1:02:58 AM] Luc: With limited success
[11/1/19, 1:03:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/1/19, 1:03:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: You‚Äôll probably be more successful in person
[11/1/19, 1:04:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not much of an extrovert
[11/1/19, 1:04:37 AM] Luc: Nah I'm not too intense
[11/1/19, 1:04:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: *too*?
[11/1/19, 1:05:03 AM] Luc: Yeah,
[11/1/19, 1:05:11 AM] Luc: 8 out of 10 is fine with you right?
‚Äé[11/1/19, 1:05:19 AM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/1/19, 1:06:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs a good one. Cause you can use it in both languages. Bet that in Portuguese as well.
[11/1/19, 1:06:34 AM] Luc: Yup :)
‚Äé[11/1/19, 1:06:43 AM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/1/19, 1:06:49 AM] Luc: Not this one unfortunately
[11/1/19, 1:07:02 AM] Luc: Indigna√ß√£o
[11/1/19, 1:08:16 AM] Luc: What kinds of books do you like to read? Or better yet which authors, if you happen to read in that manner
[11/1/19, 1:12:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: Dear lord, all those symbols.
[11/1/19, 1:14:01 AM] Luc: The hardest part is actually the gn, though you wouldn't expect it
[11/1/19, 1:14:02 AM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm quite a few.
[11/1/19, 1:14:21 AM] Luc: In jig ee nah saw
[11/1/19, 1:14:31 AM] Luc: And you're like, where did the ee come from?
[11/1/19, 1:14:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm a big fan of Henning Mankell.
[11/1/19, 1:15:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Dostoyevsky is a goodie as well.
[11/1/19, 1:15:26 AM] Luc: Not familiar, sadly
[11/1/19, 1:15:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: And Cort√°zar if I have to mention a local one
[11/1/19, 1:16:21 AM] Luc: I should revisit the classics
[11/1/19, 1:16:37 AM] Luc: I tried for a while, really, to read classic literature
[11/1/19, 1:16:43 AM] Luc: The great books, so to speak
[11/1/19, 1:17:24 AM] Luc: But I really prefer contemporary authors and I'm awful but I usually just try to read the books which are nominated for Booker prizes, and I have yet to go wrong
[11/1/19, 1:17:40 AM] Luc: As well as getting a huge range of writing styles and perspectives
[11/1/19, 1:17:53 AM] Luc: Either that or I just ask my sister for recommendations
[11/1/19, 1:18:22 AM] Luc: I'm simple ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[11/1/19, 1:20:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: Totally get you. Fortunately I got to read quite a few at university.
[11/1/19, 1:23:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: And I attend to a course in literature on Saturdays as well.
[11/1/19, 1:23:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: But I don‚Äôt usually choose classics.
[11/1/19, 1:23:44 AM] Luc: ü§ì
[11/1/19, 1:24:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: I haven‚Äôt been able to read much (just for pleasure) this year tho.
[11/1/19, 1:24:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: Muy nerd?
[11/1/19, 1:24:23 AM] Luc: Good nerd
[11/1/19, 1:24:33 AM] Luc: Reading is relaxing
[11/1/19, 1:24:56 AM] Luc: I do it in the mornings with coffee or mate
[11/1/19, 1:25:47 AM] Luc: It's just a routine now, there are very few days when I don't read for at least 15 or 20 minutes
[11/1/19, 1:26:10 AM] Luc: And it's been surprising how quickly books are finished just given consistency more than anything
[11/1/19, 1:26:59 AM] Luc: But I feel you, life gets in the way and those things fall away
[11/1/19, 1:28:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly. It sucks. But it‚Äôs just a while longer.
[11/1/19, 1:29:24 AM] Luc: Are you always up late as well?
[11/1/19, 1:29:38 AM] Luc: Or am I infringing on your beauty sleep?
[11/1/19, 1:30:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: And then I can go back to reading  books in my sofa. Watching the sunset.
[11/1/19, 1:31:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: No! It‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm just getting into bed. Had to cook dinner, iron my outfit for tomorrow and that kinda stuff.
[11/1/19, 1:32:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: But it won‚Äôt take me long to fall asleep. If I suddenly disappear, you know what happened haha
[11/1/19, 1:32:53 AM] Luc: Hahaha no worries
‚Äé[11/1/19, 1:33:18 AM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/1/19, 1:35:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: Nice!
[11/1/19, 1:35:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: We have the same pava haha
[11/1/19, 1:35:38 AM] Luc: It's a champ
[11/1/19, 1:35:42 AM] Luc: 2 years going strong
[11/1/19, 1:36:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: Great place for a nap as wall. Looks comfy.
[11/1/19, 1:37:08 AM] Luc: It needs more love but I just moved last month
[11/1/19, 1:37:26 AM] Luc: So I'll let it take its own shape with time
[11/1/19, 1:46:02 AM] Luc: Sleep well üôÉ
[11/1/19, 8:08:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: It looks great!

[11/1/19, 8:18:48 AM] Luc: Thanks you too!
[11/1/19, 8:22:09 AM] Luc: Muy cozy!!
[11/1/19, 8:23:56 AM] Luc: Sip! Mi depto anterior me qued√≥ muy grande una vez que se fue mi compa√±ero
[11/1/19, 8:54:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeahh ‚ò∫
[11/1/19, 8:54:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ahh claro
[11/1/19, 8:54:45 AM] Anita Zuddio: Y por d√≥nde estabas antes?
[11/1/19, 9:10:49 AM] Luc: No tan lejos, a siete o ocho cuadras de donde estoy actualmente üòõ
[11/1/19, 9:12:53 AM] Luc: Pero cruc√© C√≥rdoba, as√≠ que ahora no vivo en Chacarita y vivo en Colegiales, supuestamente. A m√≠ es el mismo barrio ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[11/1/19, 9:49:24 AM] Luc: ANITA pregunta seria, muy seria
[11/1/19, 9:49:39 AM] Luc: Le pones az√∫car y/o leche a tu caf√©?
[11/1/19, 10:17:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Negro
[11/1/19, 10:17:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: Con un poco de azucar/edulcorante para no destrozarme el est√≥mago por lo general.
[11/1/19, 10:24:28 AM] Luc: Casate conmigo?
[11/1/19, 10:24:43 AM] Luc: ~Casate conmigo? ~ ahh claro, copado
[11/1/19, 10:25:14 AM] Luc: As√≠ vinieron los pensamientos üòò
[11/1/19, 10:27:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajaja

[11/1/19, 10:48:03 AM] Luc: De Brasil
[11/1/19, 10:49:14 AM] Luc: Fui all√° y volv√≠ con caf√©, az√∫car de ca√±a, tapioca, y jabon
[11/1/19, 10:50:34 AM] Luc: Brasil tiene unos productos incre√≠bles. Encima me gusta la idea de disfrutar lo mejor que ofrece un pa√≠s - ac√° el vino, carne, mate, dulce de leche
[11/1/19, 10:51:46 AM] Luc: L√°, banana da terra, as frutas, o caf√©, sabonetes da marca granado, a cacha√ßa
[11/1/19, 11:13:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: Que bien eso!
[11/1/19, 11:13:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: Si, opino igual. Me gusta probar lo propio de cada pa√≠s que visito
[11/1/19, 5:05:14 PM] Luc: Cu√°l es tu pel√≠cula argentina favorita?
[11/1/19, 5:35:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me encanta este interrogatorio
[11/1/19, 5:35:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm dif√≠cil
[11/1/19, 5:36:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: El secreto de sus ojos me parece excelente. Pero favorita.. d√©jame pensarlo un segundo jaja

[11/1/19, 5:48:36 PM] Luc: Comedia debe ser
[11/1/19, 5:49:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Te dir√≠a Esperando la carroza

[11/1/19, 5:49:35 PM] Luc: Sip :)))
[11/1/19, 5:50:04 PM] Luc: Creo que la vi 4 veces ahora
[11/1/19, 5:50:53 PM] Luc: Primeras dos veces solo para poder entender en las partes cuando todos se est√°n gritando (y c√≥mo sabes hay muchas partes as√≠)
[11/1/19, 5:52:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajajaja casi toda la pel√≠cula
[11/1/19, 5:53:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Representa muy bien la familia tipo argentina

[11/1/19, 6:00:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que elegir√≠as vos?
[11/1/19, 6:01:13 PM] Luc: Igual

[11/1/19, 6:05:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jam√°s
[11/1/19, 6:05:38 PM] Luc: Te sumas a la fiesta?
[11/1/19, 6:05:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Solo me preocupar√≠a por tu integridad f√≠sica en ese caso

[11/1/19, 6:16:41 PM] Luc: Modo English on
[11/1/19, 6:17:54 PM] Luc: I actually love cumbia villera not for the music but for the culture and the fact that there's an entire underworld with its own music and vocabulary and dance and I know it all comes out of pretty dire poverty but I can't help but be extremely happy watching cumbia music videos on YouTube
[11/1/19, 6:18:00 PM] Luc: Modo English off
[11/1/19, 6:22:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: I like the way u think
[11/1/19, 6:28:04 PM] Luc: Aunque sea un bardo?
[11/1/19, 6:28:22 PM] Luc: Hay que correr riesgos en esta vida!

[11/1/19, 9:31:29 PM] Luc: para mi es lo peor
[11/1/19, 9:31:37 PM] Luc: creo que nunca en mi vida sal√≠ solo
[11/1/19, 9:31:46 PM] Luc: si no me junto con por lo menos un amigo me quedo en casa
[11/1/19, 9:34:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Comparto
[11/1/19, 9:43:22 PM] Luc: s√≠?
[11/1/19, 9:56:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: Siii. Lo que disfruto de salir es divertirme con otros jaja.

[11/2/19, 5:17:54 AM] Luc: Sorry for the late message. (Un)fortunately all photos were taken on other phones, so I have nothing exciting to share from my night of cultural appropriation. Either way I hope you enjoyed yours. Night!
[11/2/19, 9:08:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: Morning!
[11/2/19, 9:11:45 AM] Anita Zuddio: Haha no prob. How was it? And what was your costume after all?
[11/2/19, 9:12:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: I did! Slept like a baby. I really needed that.

[11/2/19, 11:30:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: How was your night?
[11/2/19, 11:32:17 AM] Luc: It was nice actually
[11/2/19, 11:32:31 AM] Luc: The party was small and in a gorgeous old house in San Telmo
[11/2/19, 11:33:41 AM] Luc: There was someone dressed as Donald Trump, so since I dressed as a stereotype of a "Mexican" (sombrero, poncho, maracas) he seemed to enjoy harassing me
[11/2/19, 11:46:09 AM] Luc: Anddddd yes I know it's a bit racist but I went to once yesterday to find myself a costume and it was the simplest thing I could put together! Also this is Argentina so nobody seemed to care whatsoever
[11/2/19, 11:56:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: Nice!
[11/2/19, 11:57:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, it doesn‚Äôt have the same impact here probably.
[11/2/19, 12:14:14 PM] Luc: What are you up to this weekend?
[11/2/19, 12:15:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: This evening I have a Christmas event for work (big Christmas fan, so I‚Äôm VERY excited haha).
[11/2/19, 12:17:14 PM] Luc: Oh yeah?
[11/2/19, 12:18:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yay! A parade. I will be helping with the costumes. The not so fun part is that I have to be there like 3 hours before it begins.
[11/2/19, 12:18:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: And tomorrow morning another Christmas plan. But that‚Äôs just for fun, I‚Äôm taking my little niece to prepare presents with Santa. üòÖ
[11/2/19, 12:18:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: How about you?
[11/2/19, 12:18:58 PM] Luc: This is so wholesome me muero
[11/2/19, 12:19:44 PM] Luc: Tonight is the birthday celebration of a friend's boyfriend but I'm not really an essential guest so I still haven't decided whether I'll go or not
[11/2/19, 12:20:26 PM] Luc: Tomorrow I'll do my Sunday thing which usually consists of a long walk and a few FaceTimes with various family members
[11/2/19, 12:20:56 PM] Luc: I've clearly already exhausted my November going out quota (on day 1) so I think I'll take it easyish
[11/2/19, 12:21:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha sounds good
[11/2/19, 12:22:43 PM] Luc: Is it not a bit early for Christmas celebrations?
[11/2/19, 12:23:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nice! If you happen to do that in the evening, and you fancy a coffee/beer (although you are a wine guy) afterwards. Let me know! My weekend is a bit packed, but I think it might be fun to meet.
[11/2/19, 12:23:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: I expected that question haha.
[11/2/19, 12:24:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: My bosses, apart from their business, own a Christmas shop (that I‚Äôve loved since I was a child, it‚Äôs mind blowing to be a part of it now).
[11/2/19, 12:25:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: And they have this ‚Äúmeet Santa‚Äù thing during November and December. So the big opening is today, with ‚ÄúSanta‚Äôs arrival‚Äù parade.
[11/2/19, 12:25:44 PM] Luc: I'd like that! I actually usually walk from where I live to parque de la memoria, so I wouldn't be exceedingly far from you
[11/2/19, 12:26:09 PM] Luc: Translation and christmas stuff? Good diversification
[11/2/19, 12:26:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oil and Christmas stuff actually hahaha
[11/2/19, 12:27:03 PM] Luc: ü§î
[11/2/19, 12:27:09 PM] Luc: Sounds like an evil empire
[11/2/19, 12:27:25 PM] Luc: Either that or they're secretly Americans
[11/2/19, 12:27:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: I work at an oil company. Well, energy company. Renewables also.
[11/2/19, 12:27:33 PM] Luc: Nothing we love more than oil and christmas
[11/2/19, 12:27:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahahah outloud
[11/2/19, 12:28:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs a looooong walk! Isn‚Äôt it?
[11/2/19, 12:29:12 PM] Luc: I guess so, about an hour?
[11/2/19, 12:29:28 PM] Luc: But it's a pleasure really
[11/2/19, 12:30:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Certainly. I really enjoy long walks as well.
[11/2/19, 12:35:18 PM] Luc: Either way maybe we could find a time this week to have a glass of wine and chat
[11/2/19, 12:35:50 PM] Luc: That is if you aren't busy until 10pm every night üòõ
[11/2/19, 1:04:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: I actually am ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ. It‚Äôs the last month of classes and I have presentations and things to hand in for university.
[11/2/19, 1:05:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I know that next Thursday I don‚Äôt have classes. Too far away? hahaha
[11/2/19, 1:05:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry
[11/2/19, 1:10:29 PM] Luc: Thursday is poker night for me
[11/2/19, 1:11:09 PM] Luc: But don't worry I can appreciate that you've got a busy schedule and I'm not a particularly impatient person :)
[11/2/19, 1:12:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nice!
[11/2/19, 1:13:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, I‚Äôm sorry again tho. my weekdays suck this year. I‚Äôve been struggling with that. But it‚Äôs almost over now.
[11/2/19, 1:13:44 PM] Luc: No need to apologize!
[11/2/19, 1:14:17 PM] Luc: Get that degree girl
[11/2/19, 1:14:43 PM] Luc: If you didn't focus especially in this last month I'd be questioning your priorities üòâ
[11/2/19, 1:22:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/2/19, 1:24:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Thanks for getting it anyway
[11/2/19, 1:26:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Still, let me know when you are finishing that walk tomorrow. If you are not too tired we can make some plans on the spot. I will probably be finishing some translations to hand in during the week anyway.
[11/2/19, 1:34:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: I wanna know more about last night‚Äôs party! Best costumes?
[11/2/19, 1:35:48 PM] Luc: Okay! I'll let you know
[11/2/19, 1:36:11 PM] Luc: I think the girl who had a very elaborate and well-crafted vagina costume would have to be the winner of the night
[11/2/19, 1:41:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt see that coming üòÇ
[11/2/19, 1:42:17 PM] Luc: neither did I hahahah
[11/2/19, 1:45:25 PM] Luc: We had a nice little group argument about "what represented what" until she just walked by and we were able to ask for clarifications. Anyway, I'll spare you a more graphic explanation but it really was very well done.
[11/2/19, 1:51:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I really can‚Äôt imagine it.
[11/2/19, 1:51:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Any other good one?
[11/2/19, 2:06:17 PM] Luc: Yeah and I sort of started typing out a description and then I was pretty uncomfortable cause I'd rather not try to explain to a woman the anatomy of a part of their own body ü§ê
[11/2/19, 2:07:29 PM] Luc: hmm nada tan notable. But the difference between the way we from the USA interpret halloween and the way south americans interpret halloween is very stark
[11/2/19, 2:07:47 PM] Luc: Like, in general, if someone is something scary and bloody, you already know they're not from the USA
[11/2/19, 2:08:06 PM] Luc: as the thing these days is more trying to do something funny or unique that's a pop-culture reference
[11/2/19, 2:12:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah I see that a lot. Much more fun.
[11/2/19, 2:14:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Like characters from old movies. But very specific.
[11/2/19, 2:15:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well. Not necessarily OLD, but not the ones easy to identify. Or easy to ‚Äúmake‚Äù.
[11/2/19, 2:15:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being clear enough ü§î
[11/2/19, 2:16:42 PM] Luc: hahah yes you are, I understand completely
[11/2/19, 2:17:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Here you will find bloody Chucky, bloody zombies, bloody Batman. And that means Halloween party.
[11/2/19, 2:23:25 PM] Luc: Can confirm
[11/2/19, 2:30:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha
[11/2/19, 2:30:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: And mexican skulls. ‚ÄòCause d√≠a de los muertos.
[11/2/19, 6:04:26 PM] Luc: How is your day going?
[11/2/19, 6:04:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Dressing elfs
[11/2/19, 6:04:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÇ
[11/2/19, 6:05:01 PM] Luc: Oh yeah?
[11/2/19, 6:05:14 PM] Luc: I think I saw some elves downtown at the march
[11/2/19, 6:05:26 PM] Luc: Maybe a different type of elf
[11/2/19, 6:05:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: *elves
[11/2/19, 6:05:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha yeah
[11/2/19, 6:05:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: This are huggable
[11/2/19, 6:06:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: *these
[11/2/19, 6:06:38 PM] Luc: So much humanity. Going home to take a very thorough shower
[11/2/19, 6:12:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: What was the march for?
‚Äé[11/2/19, 6:12:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/2/19, 6:13:20 PM] Luc: The pride parade!
[11/2/19, 6:14:05 PM] Luc: I have some very close friends who identify as lgbtq so I went with them, plenty of fun of course but exhausting to be out in the sun in such a crazy crowd
[11/2/19, 6:14:29 PM] Luc: This is next level, you guys really go all out
[11/2/19, 6:40:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Right! Some friends were going as well.
[11/2/19, 6:40:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha absolutely.
[11/2/19, 9:44:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: And so? Are you going to the bday party?
[11/2/19, 9:45:07 PM] Luc: No üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº
[11/2/19, 9:45:13 PM] Luc: I'm pretty beat
[11/2/19, 9:45:34 PM] Luc: Looking forward for a night in for the first time since maybe Tuesday
[11/2/19, 9:45:44 PM] Luc: How did your day go?
[11/2/19, 9:48:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/2/19, 9:48:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sounds good
[11/2/19, 9:49:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: (I would have done the same)
[11/2/19, 9:49:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: Amazing!
[11/2/19, 9:49:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt get to see much of the show, ‚Äòcause I was backstage.
[11/2/19, 9:49:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I loved it
[11/2/19, 9:52:50 PM] Luc: And what are you up to now?
[11/2/19, 9:53:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: A shower. First of all haha.
[11/2/19, 9:53:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: And then not much. I‚Äôm pretty beat as well.
[11/2/19, 9:55:38 PM] Luc: Some highlights from today?
‚Äé[11/2/19, 9:56:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äévideo omitted

[11/2/19, 10:01:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajajajajaja
[11/2/19, 10:02:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: It was actually really really nice. I‚Äôm exhausted tho. But all the kids were soooo happy, absolutely worth it.
[11/2/19, 10:03:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: There were a few carts with dwarves, and the skaters in between. And the last one was Santa‚Äôs sled.
[11/2/19, 10:04:11 PM] Luc: So these kids are classmates of your niece?
[11/2/19, 10:04:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Then they lit the tree with fireworks and snow.
[11/2/19, 10:04:20 PM] Luc: Or am I wrong again
[11/2/19, 10:04:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: No, from the neighborhood
[11/2/19, 10:04:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Two streets packed with people
[11/2/19, 10:04:54 PM] Luc: Oh wow
[11/2/19, 10:05:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well, two blocks. You got me haha.
[11/2/19, 10:05:28 PM] Luc: I gotcha
[11/2/19, 10:05:42 PM] Luc: How many siblings do you have?
[11/2/19, 10:06:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Three. Two brothers and a sister.
[11/2/19, 10:06:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Older, all of them.
[11/2/19, 10:06:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: You?
[11/2/19, 10:06:43 PM] Luc: Aww Anita the youngest?
[11/2/19, 10:07:06 PM] Luc: I have two older sisters, 30 and 32
[11/2/19, 10:07:58 PM] Luc: One of whom, Sandhya, who is 30, just got married at the beginning of September
[11/2/19, 10:09:19 PM] Luc: But no nieces or nephews on the way yet, which I think is actually probably totally good for the time being
[11/2/19, 10:09:36 PM] Luc: Actually probably totally. Please don't learn English from me
[11/2/19, 10:09:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajajajajaja
[11/2/19, 10:09:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: A whole new record of adverbs in a row.
[11/2/19, 10:10:20 PM] Luc: You can physically see my thought process changing in the moment
[11/2/19, 10:10:24 PM] Luc: Yikes
[11/2/19, 10:10:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/2/19, 10:10:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah. Is a matter of time anyway.
[11/2/19, 10:12:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: My sister is 36. Two nieces from her side. And then one nephew from one of my brothers (33).
[11/2/19, 10:12:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: I really couldn‚Äôt have explained it any worse haha.
[11/2/19, 10:12:53 PM] Luc: No I think I've got it
[11/2/19, 10:12:58 PM] Luc: Or at least part of the picture
[11/2/19, 10:13:11 PM] Luc: So it went girl, boy, boy, girl ?
[11/2/19, 10:13:21 PM] Luc: You being that last girl I mean
[11/2/19, 10:13:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly
[11/2/19, 10:13:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: 36, 33, 30 and 25 (me)
[11/2/19, 10:14:00 PM] Luc: Ah, your parents took a little break
[11/2/19, 10:14:17 PM] Luc: üòõ
[11/2/19, 10:15:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah. That‚Äôs a good way to say that I wasn‚Äôt expected at all hahaha.
[11/2/19, 10:15:48 PM] Luc: I wasn't going to ask but I thought you'd mentioned something like that
[11/2/19, 10:16:10 PM] Luc: I don't think I was really expected either
[11/2/19, 10:17:09 PM] Luc: I assume that you enjoy having nieces and nephews? Are you just the defacto babysitter now as the youngest sibling?
[11/2/19, 10:18:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: I am. Almost every Friday. Of my nephew mostly.
[11/2/19, 10:19:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: And I‚Äôm the godmother of the youngest of my nieces (just one month old). So I‚Äôll probably end up being her nanny as well haha.
[11/2/19, 10:20:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: I never expected it, but apparently I‚Äôm really good at aunting.
[11/2/19, 10:20:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: (And inventing words as well)
[11/2/19, 10:27:22 PM] Luc: Aunting is totally valid !!!
[11/2/19, 10:27:25 PM] Luc: Hahaha
[11/2/19, 10:27:33 PM] Luc: Sorry I was making stickers, my.new hobby

[11/2/19, 10:58:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: So there was a picture of the mexican guy after all
[11/2/19, 10:58:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha

[11/2/19, 11:04:21 PM] Luc: All that wheelbarrowing
[11/2/19, 11:05:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha rescuing teddy bears
[11/2/19, 11:05:34 PM] Luc: I used to cut their hair
[11/2/19, 11:05:44 PM] Luc: I would line up my stuffed animals and give them haircuts
[11/2/19, 11:05:48 PM] Luc: Every few weeks
[11/2/19, 11:06:01 PM] Luc: My mom thought it was hilarious
[11/2/19, 11:06:04 PM] Luc: Didn't even stop me
[11/2/19, 11:06:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: ü§î
[11/2/19, 11:06:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: How many times did you get to do it before they were out of hair? haha
[11/2/19, 11:06:51 PM] Luc: Yeah so they're all gone now but they were basically all bald at the end
[11/2/19, 11:07:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/2/19, 11:07:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: While you were pretending to be a hairdresser I was pretending to be a drunk

[11/2/19, 11:26:35 PM] Luc: So I assume you like kids a lot?
[11/2/19, 11:27:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: A limited number and a limited amount of time probably. But yes haha.
[11/2/19, 11:37:35 PM] Luc: I think "a limited amount of time" may be tough if you have your own
[11/2/19, 11:44:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Haha I meant right now.
[11/3/19, 12:17:37 PM] Luc: Buenas :)

[11/3/19, 2:36:35 PM] Luc: Demasiado
[11/3/19, 2:37:53 PM] Luc: Igual tuve que afeitarmelo porque hay una chance que te veo hoy, si no se te complic√≥ el d√≠a?

[11/3/19, 3:36:33 PM] Luc: M√°s o menos flexible pero no me debo comprometer por mucho tiempo porque todav√≠a tengo una banda de quehaceres
[11/3/19, 3:36:42 PM] Luc: Ten√≠as algo en mente?
[11/3/19, 3:39:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not really jaja. M√°s espontaneo que otra cosa. Helado, caf√©, birra, lo que pintara de acuerdo a la hora.
[11/3/19, 3:41:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Estoy en la misma. No prefer√≠s que coordinemos para.. viernes maybe? O s√°bado si preferis. Se que es un poco lejos. Pero me parece mejor para wine and chat. Y no estar pendientes del reloj. üòä
[11/3/19, 3:42:19 PM] Luc: PERO ANITA ME AFEITE POR VOS
[11/3/19, 3:42:34 PM] Luc: Haha s√≠ creo que nos queda mejor el viernes o s√°bado

[11/3/19, 3:44:15 PM] Luc: Nah est√°s bien :)
[11/3/19, 3:44:40 PM] Luc: El viernes vas a la facu tambi√©n?

[11/3/19, 3:45:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: We have a plan then ‚ò∫
[11/3/19, 3:46:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me parece mejor para no estar pendientes de la hora. No? No me gusta estar en un lugar pensando que al rato tengo que estar en otro.
[11/3/19, 3:48:10 PM] Luc: Exacto. A mi tampoco
[11/3/19, 3:48:20 PM] Luc: Y m√°s que nada
[11/3/19, 3:48:38 PM] Luc: Depende como fue la semana de mi mam√° a veces me habla por horas
[11/3/19, 3:48:49 PM] Luc: Y la escucho como buen hijo
[11/3/19, 3:49:10 PM] Luc: Y se me complica el d√≠a hahaha
[11/3/19, 4:18:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja me parece muy bien!
[11/3/19, 4:28:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ya est√°s en pleno paseo? O a√∫n no?

[11/3/19, 5:20:49 PM] Luc: Es entre unos barrios
[11/3/19, 5:21:01 PM] Luc: Supongo que uno le podr√≠a decir Belgrano o colegiales
[11/3/19, 5:21:07 PM] Luc: O Ca√±itas
[11/3/19, 5:21:20 PM] Luc: T√©cnicamente creo que est√° en Belgrano por las calles

[11/3/19, 5:49:02 PM] Luc: Obvio!
[11/3/19, 5:49:30 PM] Luc: Alguna vez fuiste a ver los aviones aterrizando?
[11/3/19, 8:02:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mm nop. Veo gente ah√≠ en la costanera siempre, pero nunca me llamo la atenci√≥n hacerlo.

[11/3/19, 8:07:19 PM] Luc: En serio?
[11/3/19, 8:07:25 PM] Luc: Pero son car√≠simos
[11/3/19, 8:07:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Asumo que son buenos, sino no se explica tanto fanatismo
[11/3/19, 8:07:41 PM] Luc: O sea, en comparaci√≥n con lo que te sale en los EEUU
[11/3/19, 8:07:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Te juro. Bueno, exagere con el promedio
[11/3/19, 8:07:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero se pusieron de moda
[11/3/19, 8:08:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Los compran alla y los traen para vender.
[11/3/19, 8:08:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Totally agreed
[11/3/19, 8:09:34 PM] Luc: Ya completaste las traducciones?
[11/3/19, 8:11:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nooo. Reci√©n estoy por planchar la ropa para la semana (tengo uniforme en el trabajo ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ) y preparando comida. Dejo eso hecho y me pongo a traducir lo que resta del d√≠a.
[11/3/19, 8:11:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: O ese es el plan at least
[11/3/19, 8:12:06 PM] Luc: Uff
[11/3/19, 8:12:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Necesito un d√≠a m√°s de fin de semana jajaja
[11/3/19, 8:12:29 PM] Luc: Parece mucho
[11/3/19, 8:12:54 PM] Luc: üòï
[11/3/19, 8:13:09 PM] Luc: No te gusta el uniforme?
[11/3/19, 8:14:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ahora me acostumbre
[11/3/19, 8:14:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Al principio me parec√≠a muy raro. Pero esta bueno no tener que pensar qu√© ponerse a la ma√±ana.
[11/3/19, 8:15:41 PM] Luc: Hahaha pero espera
[11/3/19, 8:15:58 PM] Luc: Te cambias o vas a la facu de uniforme tambi√©n?
[11/3/19, 8:16:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Voy con el uniforme.
[11/3/19, 8:16:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es ropa formal b√°sicamente
[11/3/19, 8:18:24 PM] Luc: Hahahahaha oh Ani debes ser el estudiante m√°s profesional de todos
[11/3/19, 8:21:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja no te quepa duda. Estoy para atender los tel√©fonos de la universidad si quieren.
[11/3/19, 8:21:42 PM] Luc: Hahahahah
[11/3/19, 8:21:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Te diste cuenta que venimos alternando un d√≠a de charla en ingl√©s y uno en espa√±ol? üòÇ
[11/3/19, 8:21:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Love it
[11/3/19, 8:22:25 PM] Luc: Arranque hoy en espa√±ol de prop√≥sito
[11/3/19, 8:22:58 PM] Luc: No quiero que tengas que siempre bancarme y hablar ingl√©s conmigo
[11/3/19, 8:23:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja
[11/3/19, 8:23:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Olv√≠date, a mi me divierte y me es √∫til tenerlo activo. Si a vos te sirve de descanso, bienvenido.
[11/3/19, 8:24:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Lo que prefieras is fine by me ‚ò∫
[11/3/19, 8:24:51 PM] Luc: Ya se que podes, probablemente te cuesta menos que a m√≠ hablando espa√±ol
[11/3/19, 8:25:02 PM] Luc: Pero 1. tengo que seguir mejorando
[11/3/19, 8:25:37 PM] Luc: Y 2. Igualdad importa, en todo no?
[11/3/19, 8:35:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Agreed.
[11/3/19, 8:35:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si es por eso, seguimos haciendo un d√≠a y un d√≠a.
[11/3/19, 8:35:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Democr√°tico jaja
[11/3/19, 8:37:55 PM] Luc: Me alegro que hayas entendido
[11/3/19, 8:38:03 PM] Luc: Realmente me importa
[11/3/19, 8:38:30 PM] Luc: üôÉ
[11/3/19, 8:39:00 PM] Luc: Y te pido perd√≥n con anticipaci√≥n de todos los errores que est√°n por venir üò∂
[11/3/19, 8:39:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja
[11/3/19, 8:39:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ning√∫n problema
[11/3/19, 8:39:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Igual mezclo mucho con ingl√©s cuando hablo a diario, as√≠ que eso va a seguir sucediendo probably
[11/3/19, 8:40:11 PM] Luc: Hahah esa parte no me molesta por nada
[11/3/19, 8:44:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÅ
[11/3/19, 8:45:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: C√≥mo fue la charla con tu mam√° al final? Extensa?
[11/3/19, 8:45:31 PM] Luc: Hahaha extensa, s√≠
[11/3/19, 8:46:19 PM] Luc: Me dio una descripci√≥n detallada de una exhibici√≥n que vio hoy en un museo de arte asi√°tico
[11/3/19, 8:46:54 PM] Luc: Esta bien
[11/3/19, 8:47:34 PM] Luc: Estuvo sin electricidad durante unos d√≠as de la semana pasada por el tema de los fuegos
[11/3/19, 8:47:57 PM] Luc: Est√° babysitting Bruce
[11/3/19, 8:48:04 PM] Luc: El perro de mi hermana
[11/3/19, 8:48:21 PM] Luc: Nada, cosas as√≠ me cuenta :)
[11/3/19, 9:02:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: Uyy est√°n cerca?
[11/3/19, 9:03:50 PM] Luc: ?
[11/3/19, 9:04:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja perd√≥n, cite mal
[11/3/19, 9:04:19 PM] Luc: Ahhh hahahah
[11/3/19, 9:04:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Por esto lo preguntaba
[11/3/19, 9:04:45 PM] Luc: No tan cerca pero hay un riesgo ya que todo est√° muy seca ahora
[11/3/19, 9:04:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Aparentemente no puedo planchar y escribir a la vez üòÇ
[11/3/19, 9:04:55 PM] Luc: Seco
[11/3/19, 9:05:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Claro üòï
[11/3/19, 9:05:38 PM] Luc: Nah est√° ahora en la ciudad con en el departamento de mi hermana

[11/3/19, 9:14:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Too cute
[11/3/19, 9:27:54 PM] Luc: Le puse Bruce yo
[11/3/19, 9:28:04 PM] Luc: Porque con sus orejas me parece Batman
[11/3/19, 9:28:14 PM] Luc: aka Bruce Wayne
[11/3/19, 9:38:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja
[11/3/19, 9:38:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Y su nombre real es?
[11/3/19, 9:38:56 PM] Luc: Bruce!
[11/3/19, 9:39:06 PM] Luc: Lo elig√≠, deber√≠a haber dicho
[11/3/19, 9:40:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ahhh. No, est√° bien. Se pod√≠a entender de la dos formas jaja
[11/3/19, 9:40:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: y que tal tu domingo post paseo?
[11/3/19, 9:55:57 PM] Luc: Ahora tranquilo :)
[11/3/19, 9:56:44 PM] Luc: Viendo el SNL de anoche
[11/3/19, 9:59:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja que bien!
[11/3/19, 9:59:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Buen cierre de fin de semana
[11/3/19, 9:59:59 PM] Luc: Y vos,
[11/3/19, 10:00:04 PM] Luc: Planchaste
[11/3/19, 10:00:09 PM] Luc: Cocinaste
[11/3/19, 10:00:16 PM] Luc: Laburaste?
[11/3/19, 10:00:21 PM] Luc: Estoy impresionado
[11/3/19, 10:01:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja si. Uniforme, check. Comida para la semana, check. Ahora me prepare un caf√© y puse la carrera de F1 de hoy (big fan). Seguramente la deje de fondo mientras traduzco.0
[11/3/19, 10:06:52 PM] Luc: Caf√© a las 10?
[11/3/19, 10:07:05 PM] Luc: So' loka
[11/3/19, 10:07:14 PM] Luc: Sabes que?
[11/3/19, 10:07:24 PM] Luc: Nunca en mi vida vi una carrera f1
[11/3/19, 10:08:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja tomo uno todas las noches. I‚Äôm broken apparently. No me afecta al sue√±o. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/3/19, 10:08:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nunca?!
[11/3/19, 10:08:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Justo estoy viendo la de US.
[11/3/19, 10:09:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Bueno, tiene que gustarte. Sino debe ser muy aburrido jaja.
[11/3/19, 11:21:29 PM] Luc: Wow! Me afecta, por eso intento no tomarme nada de cafeina despues del mediodia, mas o menos
[11/3/19, 11:22:38 PM] Luc: y nunca! en serio. Ni sabia que las teniamos en los estados unidos? pense que era algo de europa?
[11/3/19, 11:23:07 PM] Luc: Pero me gustaria ver una!
[11/3/19, 11:27:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Solo hasta el mediod√≠a? Es mucho tiempo sin caf√©, no podr√≠a jaja.
[11/3/19, 11:28:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hay circuitos por todo el mundo casi. Menos Africa.
[11/3/19, 11:29:47 PM] Luc: Podriamos ver y me ense√±as un poquito algun d√≠a?
[11/3/19, 11:30:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: You should! Ya no quedan muchas este a√±o. Dos nada m√°s si mi memoria no falla.
[11/3/19, 11:30:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Por supuesto! No se cu√°n capacitada estoy para ense√±ar
[11/3/19, 11:30:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero te comparto lo que se üòÖ
[11/3/19, 11:34:12 PM] Luc: Bien!
[11/3/19, 11:34:36 PM] Luc: Che, avis√°me cuando est√©s terminando tus tareas y tal, as√≠ charlamos un poquito antes de dormir
[11/3/19, 11:41:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Dale ‚ò∫
[11/4/19, 12:27:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Still up?
[11/4/19, 12:27:49 AM] Luc: Always
[11/4/19, 12:27:57 AM] Luc: Happy english day
[11/4/19, 12:29:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: No sab√≠a que era hoy!
[11/4/19, 12:29:45 AM] Anita Zuddio: Happy English day ‚ò∫
[11/4/19, 12:29:48 AM] Luc: Hahah no! I just mean it's past midnight
[11/4/19, 12:29:56 AM] Luc: Por eso cambiamos?
[11/4/19, 12:30:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ahhh jajaja. My bad ‚úãüèº
[11/4/19, 12:30:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: Nah, me sali√≥ as√≠ nada m√°s jaja
[11/4/19, 12:30:44 AM] Luc: You're good
[11/4/19, 12:31:37 AM] Luc: I swear I had some great conversational topic to ask you about but now I'm trying to understand this Chile situation and I got very distracted and I forgot ü§Ø
[11/4/19, 12:31:46 AM] Luc: Finally done with everything?
[11/4/19, 12:40:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: Apparently the gap between the upper and the lower classes is huge (I mean, bigger than it was known) and there had been great dissatisfaction for a while because of that. And the raise in the metro ticket prices was just a trigger.
[11/4/19, 12:41:20 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not even close. But I still have a few days left.
[11/4/19, 12:41:58 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll have to make use of my lunch hours to finish everything. üòí
[11/4/19, 12:42:35 AM] Luc: Yeah, this is interesting
[11/4/19, 12:43:11 AM] Luc: Having studied economics I spend a lot of time wondering why things work one way here and another way where I was born, if one believes (the way that I believe) that people are the same everywhere
[11/4/19, 12:44:07 AM] Luc: And it occurs to me that in developed countries, the tolerance for inequality is much higher because the baseline quality of life is also much "better" (I say "better" in quotes because this is a very subjective measure and it's a big reductive to measure happiness by looking at money alone)
[11/4/19, 12:44:53 AM] Luc: And here in South America, or at least from what I know of Brasil and Argentina, there is far less tolerance and it results in an even further stratified society wherein you start to see security become a big issue and anxiety for the upper class(es)
[11/4/19, 12:45:07 AM] Luc: I hope I dont
[11/4/19, 12:45:10 AM] Luc: bore you with this
[11/4/19, 12:45:14 AM] Luc: weird wonk talk
[11/4/19, 12:45:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not at all
[11/4/19, 12:45:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: I agree with you
[11/4/19, 12:47:00 AM] Luc: It's not quite so stark here but what always impressed me (and not in a positive way) were the fences (electrified, spikes, multiple layers) and security guards that exist all over S√£o Paulo's wealthier neighborhoods
[11/4/19, 12:47:55 AM] Anita Zuddio: And, here at least, for many years the middle class worked as a ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù. That‚Äôs is no longer the case. Or it is, but not as it used to be. That doesn‚Äôt help at all.
[11/4/19, 12:49:00 AM] Luc: Yeah, you're right. I guess buffer isn't the ideal purpose but rather a bridge would be what you want to aim for.
[11/4/19, 12:50:57 AM] Luc: Nonetheless, from my relatively uninformed position I was under the impression that Chile was like the cousin with his shit together, the stable one with the decent job?
[11/4/19, 12:51:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: Both actually. What I meant was that the middle class used to be like some sort of cushion.
[11/4/19, 12:54:25 AM] Luc: I understand completely, you're right - as it should be in theory the majority with the power to keep the wealthy from monopolizing resources and to keep the poor from tyrannizing or villainizing those who accumulate wealth
[11/4/19, 12:58:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha yeah. They were the ones who had implemented the best aspects of the US economy actually. That‚Äôs what they say. I remember having read about this Friedman guy, that supposedly brought from the states all this ‚Äúnew ideas‚Äù that saved Chile‚Äôs economy.
[11/4/19, 12:58:31 AM] Luc: Actually it's an interesting story
[11/4/19, 12:59:05 AM] Luc: Pinochet didn't know anything about economics, and he basically outsourced all his economic policy to a group of Chilean economists who had studied at University of Chicago under Friedman
[11/4/19, 12:59:20 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs what I had in mind, and you perfectly put into words. üòÇ
[11/4/19, 12:59:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs it! The Chicago boys, right?
[11/4/19, 12:59:58 AM] Luc: Correct :)
[11/4/19, 1:00:07 AM] Luc: :))))
[11/4/19, 1:00:34 AM] Luc: And they implemented a very Friedmanist doctorine over there, which worked really well to help pull Chile forward but of course also caused a lot of pain in the short term. And having been associated with Pinochet's rather awful regime (speaking of human rights)
[11/4/19, 1:00:48 AM] Luc: It didn't really get recognized as a working model that other countries could draw from
[11/4/19, 1:00:59 AM] Luc: Though in many ways it was, it is
[11/4/19, 1:01:45 AM] Luc: Not that it's perfect.. I think after a certain amount of time without the proper regulations resources will start to get allocated to a smaller percentage at the top
[11/4/19, 1:02:08 AM] Luc: And then bam, you have a nice little revolution and things sort of go to shit and then we have to start all over
[11/4/19, 1:02:29 AM] Luc: So yeah, Chile :)
[11/4/19, 1:02:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: No idea what you are talking about.
[11/4/19, 1:02:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: üò™
‚Äé[11/4/19, 1:03:22 AM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/4/19, 1:04:39 AM] Anita Zuddio: Bumble didn‚Äôt warn you about the level of nerdiness of your matches, right? üòÖ
[11/4/19, 1:05:05 AM] Luc: They should have put that in, a 1-10
[11/4/19, 1:05:12 AM] Luc: I realize now I have no idea who this sticker is
[11/4/19, 1:05:42 AM] Luc: I thought it was mister JDP
[11/4/19, 1:05:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha they should
[11/4/19, 1:05:55 AM] Anita Zuddio: This?
[11/4/19, 1:05:59 AM] Luc: Yeah
[11/4/19, 1:06:50 AM] Anita Zuddio: Guillermo Moreno
[11/4/19, 1:07:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: Secretario de Comercio Interior durante parte de los gobiernos de los Kirchner
[11/4/19, 1:07:39 AM] Luc: Thank you hahahahah
[11/4/19, 1:07:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: (Ameritaba el espa√±ol)
[11/4/19, 1:08:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: You should watch some videos of him in YouTube. He has no filters whatsoever.
[11/4/19, 1:09:05 AM] Luc: Oh yes?
[11/4/19, 1:09:12 AM] Luc: Very good, I will
[11/4/19, 1:09:52 AM] Luc: Sorry for talking your ear off üò∂
[11/4/19, 1:10:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/4/19, 1:11:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: Are you kidding? I certainly don‚Äôt express myself as good as you do, but I really enjoy talking about this.
[11/4/19, 1:12:34 AM] Luc: I can't even imagine trying to write all that in Spanish, so don't worry, you're totally fine
[11/4/19, 1:12:54 AM] Anita Zuddio: Haha thanks
[11/4/19, 1:13:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm learning about economics. Will return the favor with Spanish, promise.
[11/4/19, 1:13:39 AM] Luc: ‚ù§
[11/4/19, 1:14:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: Did I get to tell you that I met Santa this morning?
[11/4/19, 1:14:23 AM] Luc: Everyone is learning about economics, even economists. We basically have no idea why things work the way they do
[11/4/19, 1:14:32 AM] Luc: For some reason that makes it more fun
[11/4/19, 1:14:36 AM] Luc: NO
[11/4/19, 1:14:38 AM] Luc: picture?
‚Äé[11/4/19, 1:14:52 AM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/4/19, 1:15:15 AM] Luc: hahahah Santa looks like Christian Bale in disguise
[11/4/19, 1:15:23 AM] Luc: Is this your niece?
[11/4/19, 1:16:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha right next to Kathy Bates
[11/4/19, 1:16:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap
[11/4/19, 1:17:12 AM] Luc: Who plays Santa?
[11/4/19, 1:17:36 AM] Luc: The beard is impressive
[11/4/19, 1:17:39 AM] Anita Zuddio: She got all shy and didn‚Äôt want to meet him by herself (and it certainly wasn‚Äôt so hard for me to go say hi).
[11/4/19, 1:19:45 AM] Anita Zuddio: Some random guy. They literally saw him at a cafe and asked him if he wanted to play Santa.
[11/4/19, 1:19:55 AM] Luc: hahahahahah
[11/4/19, 1:20:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: He is a biker. Like Harley Davidson style. Can you believe it?
[11/4/19, 1:20:10 AM] Luc: Yes I actually can
[11/4/19, 1:20:20 AM] Luc: But also this is so Argentina
[11/4/19, 1:20:33 AM] Luc: To just see someone who looks like they could be Santa and walk up and ask them
[11/4/19, 1:20:51 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/4/19, 1:21:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs true
[11/4/19, 1:22:36 AM] Luc: So today was day two of the festivities?
[11/4/19, 1:22:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: I can‚Äôt explain you the face of my niece when she entered the room (it was literally snowing).
[11/4/19, 1:24:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly. Kids were supposed to be Santa‚Äôs helpers. So we made a present and a card, that they will donate in Christmas.
[11/4/19, 1:25:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Then Mrs Claus gave them ginger cookies. And Santa appeared at the end of the day to thank them.
[11/4/19, 1:25:48 AM] Luc: You really do take this quite seriously
[11/4/19, 1:25:58 AM] Anita Zuddio: My inner kid can‚Äôt still get over it.
[11/4/19, 1:26:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha
[11/4/19, 1:26:02 AM] Luc: I guess it's nice
[11/4/19, 1:26:07 AM] Luc: I loved christmas as a kid
[11/4/19, 1:26:14 AM] Luc: Now it's sort of stressful
[11/4/19, 1:26:27 AM] Luc: Because we can never get everyone in the same place
[11/4/19, 1:27:06 AM] Luc: Also unrelated but your niece has curly hair and I realize I almost never see kids (or anyone) with curly hair here
[11/4/19, 1:28:05 AM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm there are. But not as curly as hers. Just wavy probably.
[11/4/19, 1:29:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, that‚Äôs true. We have the same problem and we all live in the same city.
[11/4/19, 1:29:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/4/19, 1:29:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: Were you at home last Christmas?
[11/4/19, 1:29:48 AM] Luc: Hahahaha well, can't help you here
[11/4/19, 1:30:16 AM] Luc: No, I haven't been able to celebrate Christmas with my family for about 3 years
[11/4/19, 1:30:47 AM] Luc: But this year I will, and I'll get to go up to Portland to see my friends too
[11/4/19, 1:31:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs awesome!
[11/4/19, 1:32:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: How long are you staying?
[11/4/19, 1:32:41 AM] Luc: I shouldn't stay more than about 18 days but I still only bought the ticket there
[11/4/19, 1:34:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs too precise haha. Why 18?
[11/4/19, 1:35:25 AM] Luc: Sort of complicated and silly but if you live outside the USA and you come back for more than 35 days each year they basically treat you like a citizen and require you to buy health insurance in the USA and pay taxes on any income etc.
[11/4/19, 1:35:34 AM] Luc: I spent a couple weeks in April there
[11/4/19, 1:35:47 AM] Luc: So I think I have like 18 or 20 days
[11/4/19, 1:36:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ohh got it. Very silly indeed.
[11/4/19, 1:36:27 AM] Luc: Doesn't bother me. I'm usually ready to be back here after about 4 days
[11/4/19, 1:37:20 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha it works the other way around for me when I‚Äôm there.
[11/4/19, 1:38:07 AM] Luc: You don't want to leave?
[11/4/19, 1:38:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly
[11/4/19, 1:39:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: Mostly because of the food, believe it or not.
[11/4/19, 1:40:05 AM] Luc: I'll choose not to believe it
[11/4/19, 1:40:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha
[11/4/19, 1:40:12 AM] Luc: But then ask for clarification
[11/4/19, 1:41:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: If clarification includes you cooking some American dishes, I‚Äôll be as clear as you want.
[11/4/19, 1:41:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: üòÅ
[11/4/19, 1:41:55 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry to interrupt the talk, but I‚Äôm gonna try get some sleep. Loooong day tomorrow.
[11/4/19, 1:42:17 AM] Luc: I understand entirely
[11/4/19, 1:42:26 AM] Luc: I apologize for keeping you up this late
[11/4/19, 1:42:30 AM] Luc: I like talking to you
[11/4/19, 1:42:39 AM] Luc: Have a good night!
[11/4/19, 1:43:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: Don‚Äôt! So do I ‚ò∫
[11/4/19, 1:43:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: You too!
[11/4/19, 10:59:49 AM] Luc: Nice little storm we've got going today
[11/4/19, 11:04:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: Grabbed my phone to wish you a nice day.. in spite of the weather üòÖ
[11/4/19, 11:04:50 AM] Luc: Aw I appreciate it
[11/4/19, 11:04:58 AM] Luc: I hope you're not dead tired
[11/4/19, 11:14:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: Might be kinda silly, but I like to send ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù messages. I think it‚Äôs nice to start the day like that.
[11/4/19, 11:25:10 AM] Luc: 1. Not silly at all
2. Noted :)
[11/4/19, 11:25:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha it wasn‚Äôt easy to wake up, must admit. But I didn‚Äôt rest enough during the weekend. It‚Äôs just that.
[11/4/19, 11:25:51 AM] Luc: The finish line is in sight!
[11/4/19, 11:26:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeahhh üôåüèº
[11/4/19, 11:26:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: How about you?
[11/4/19, 11:26:56 AM] Luc: Me nah
[11/4/19, 11:27:31 AM] Luc: This week will be really light as we are just planning a new project
[11/4/19, 11:28:23 AM] Luc: So I'm chillin like Presi Beto just waiting for things to ramp up
‚Äé[11/4/19, 11:28:25 AM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/4/19, 11:29:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajajajajaja
[11/4/19, 11:29:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: Did you make that one?!
[11/4/19, 11:34:25 AM] Luc: The image no the sticker yes
[11/4/19, 11:35:17 AM] Luc: Today feels like a mate day
[11/4/19, 11:38:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha it‚Äôs amazing
[11/4/19, 11:38:51 AM] Luc: I mostly focus my efforts on Del Ca√±o
[11/4/19, 11:39:03 AM] Luc: I think he's the most memeable
[11/4/19, 11:39:54 AM] Luc: Just indignance levels at üíØ
‚Äé[11/4/19, 11:40:05 AM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/4/19, 11:42:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: Oh yes it does. But we don‚Äôt (can‚Äôt) have any here. So I‚Äôll have to stick to coffee.
[11/4/19, 11:42:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/4/19, 11:42:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: Absolutely
[11/4/19, 11:42:52 AM] Luc: I've never enjoyed watching a debate more
[11/4/19, 11:42:56 AM] Luc: Can't?
[11/4/19, 11:45:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: It was cute to see how much he had rehearsed each intervention.
‚Äé[11/4/19, 11:46:42 AM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/4/19, 11:48:10 AM] Luc: Do you remember a couple years ago they saw him buying dollars at the bank? After of course he spends most of his time talking about how dolarization is ruining the country (it's not).
[11/4/19, 11:48:32 AM] Luc: And then he says "oh they were for a trip to brazil for a workers party conference"
[11/4/19, 11:48:39 AM] Luc: He has a heart of gold
‚Äé[11/4/19, 11:48:57 AM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/4/19, 12:33:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: I work for the board of directors. So it‚Äôs kinda fancy up here haha. We have coffee and tea only.
[11/4/19, 12:34:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/4/19, 12:34:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: I had forgotten about that!
[11/4/19, 12:36:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: I can‚Äôt stop faving your stickers üòÇ
[11/4/19, 12:38:00 PM] Luc: no pero hasta el pap√° toma mate mientras trabaja
[11/4/19, 12:38:13 PM] Luc: Anyway I gotcha
[11/4/19, 12:38:26 PM] Luc: Is the company foreign by some chance? Or has many foreign clients?
[11/4/19, 12:38:57 PM] Luc: I used to drink Mate at my desk in San Francisco and you have no idea how many people thought it was some new innovative way to get high
[11/4/19, 12:39:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: I know! üò©
[11/4/19, 12:39:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I‚Äôve been told that by friends from abroad as well.
[11/4/19, 12:40:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: I made them try it when they were here, and they were all suspicious haha
[11/4/19, 12:41:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nop, it‚Äôs from here. I guess they must sell abroad, but not sure to whom.
[11/4/19, 12:41:45 PM] Luc: Well I kept a glass jar of yerba in my cajonera
[11/4/19, 12:41:55 PM] Luc: So you can imagine just how clandestine it appeared
[11/4/19, 12:42:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha you are not helping, Luc!
[11/4/19, 12:44:01 PM] Luc: I was spreading Argentine culture throughout the world, okay?
[11/4/19, 12:46:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/4/19, 12:46:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: True that
[11/4/19, 12:46:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: You should also spread dulce de leche
[11/4/19, 12:47:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was running out of chocolates at home (yeah, I keep a stash of chocolate/candies) and my mate here brought me a jar of homemade peanut butter.
[11/4/19, 12:47:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: I can‚Äôt begin to explain how happy I am right now haha.
[11/4/19, 12:48:13 PM] Luc: Oh a peanut butter fan? Very good
[11/4/19, 12:48:26 PM] Luc: I remember when I came to visit here it basically didn't exist (a few years ago)
[11/4/19, 12:48:31 PM] Luc: And now it's everywhere
[11/4/19, 12:50:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, that‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs easier to get now.
[11/4/19, 12:57:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Working from home today? Or did you go out anyway? (I hate to get caught under the rain, but some people like it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ)
[11/4/19, 12:58:44 PM] Luc: I love the rain, I'm from Portland! But I'm waiting for some things to arrive today so I'm at home.
[11/4/19, 12:59:21 PM] Luc: Since I imagine I'll have a very light week this week work-wise I'm going to try to tie together loose ends with regards to the apartment and such
[11/4/19, 1:00:07 PM] Luc: I moved in September and I've been too busy to finish everything so _hopefully_ this week will make that possible
[11/4/19, 1:00:48 PM] Luc: As well as the USA just fell back due to daylight savings time so I have an extra hour each morning before anyone bothers me with emails or requests
[11/4/19, 1:02:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs great!
[11/4/19, 1:03:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Administrative stuff or furniture and such?
[11/4/19, 1:04:37 PM] Luc: A little bit of everything
[11/4/19, 1:05:01 PM] Luc: I guess you know how it is to live alone
[11/4/19, 1:05:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: I do haha. And how it is to not have the time to get things done.
[11/4/19, 1:05:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/4/19, 1:07:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: The last few months I decided to do all those things that I kept pushing. Like buying and hanging some paintings. All my walls were WHITE for a year almost.
[11/4/19, 1:09:08 PM] Luc: I feel you!
[11/4/19, 1:10:26 PM] Luc: I really like photographs (especially black and white) and I have a lot that I'd like to print but my problem problem is mostly that I go to have them printed and they don't come out properly calibrated or they have some weird color cast or they're too contrasty or they're not properly aligned or sized on the paper and they end up bothering me more than pleasing me
[11/4/19, 1:11:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/4/19, 1:12:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one with an (almost) OCD.
[11/4/19, 1:12:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÇ
[11/4/19, 1:13:17 PM] Luc: Ha, you're definitely not alone
[11/4/19, 1:13:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs why I got a painting that it‚Äôs pretty much an overlapping of stains (but of course I hanged it carefully to make sure that it was aligned).
‚Äé[11/4/19, 1:14:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/4/19, 1:14:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: *that is
[11/4/19, 1:15:00 PM] Luc: I recognize your chairs
[11/4/19, 1:15:30 PM] Luc: (:
[11/4/19, 1:15:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha. Yeah, everyone has them. I know. üòÖ
[11/4/19, 1:16:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I got a traditional table, so that I can change them whenever I want and don‚Äôt ruin the style.
[11/4/19, 1:16:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÅ
[11/4/19, 1:16:40 PM] Luc: My old roommate (who went back to the states in May)
[11/4/19, 1:16:43 PM] Luc: bought 6 of them
[11/4/19, 1:16:44 PM] Luc: IN ORANGE
[11/4/19, 1:16:52 PM] Luc: And then left, as I mentioned
[11/4/19, 1:17:01 PM] Luc: And I had to find someone who wanted to buy 6 of them in ORANGE
[11/4/19, 1:17:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/4/19, 1:17:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Did you?
[11/4/19, 1:17:43 PM] Luc: I did, finally
[11/4/19, 1:22:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Lucky you
[11/4/19, 1:22:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: And you got new ones?
[11/4/19, 1:23:29 PM] Luc: Yes and no
[11/4/19, 1:23:40 PM] Luc: I didn't keep the table, I didn't like it either
[11/4/19, 1:24:13 PM] Luc: I didn't really keep anything, if I'm being honest, most of it was his and I didn't care much for it
[11/4/19, 1:25:39 PM] Luc: It's a bit difficult to explain, I have a sort of raised kitchen island here, so I bought a couple benches for that
[11/4/19, 1:25:56 PM] Luc: Haven't had the occasion to entertain yet so it hasn't been a priority to replace the table and chairs
[11/4/19, 1:35:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Got it. That‚Äôs enough when you live alone anyway.
[11/4/19, 1:36:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: I only use the table when I‚Äôm studying or with somebody else.
[11/4/19, 1:38:12 PM] Luc: Exactly
[11/4/19, 1:38:33 PM] Luc: And more than anything I just like not having to maneuver around things and I don't want to crowd my living room just yet
[11/4/19, 1:38:37 PM] Luc: So I'm gonna hold off and see
[11/4/19, 1:46:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs a good plan
[11/4/19, 1:57:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: What is life with a roommate like?
[11/4/19, 1:57:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Did you know him/her already?
[11/4/19, 1:58:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve always wondered about that
[11/4/19, 1:59:18 PM] Luc: Housemate I should have said
[11/4/19, 1:59:30 PM] Luc: I live alone now of course, we already talked about that
[11/4/19, 1:59:47 PM] Luc: Will (he) has been a friend for 8 years now, since college
[11/4/19, 2:00:05 PM] Luc: We are best friends, so it was just a joy honestly
[11/4/19, 2:02:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh cool
[11/4/19, 2:03:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. I meant before he left haha.
[11/4/19, 2:04:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: I spent a month studying in the UK with my best friend and we got along well. But it wasn‚Äôt that long.
[11/4/19, 2:06:13 PM] Luc: That must have been amazing
[11/4/19, 2:06:21 PM] Luc: Did you enjoy it? London I assume?
[11/4/19, 2:10:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah! I was young and I‚Äôm not sure if I was completely aware of how lucky I was to be there. But it was amazing.
[11/4/19, 2:32:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: We lived with a family in the outskirts of the city. And went to an institute in Central London.
[11/4/19, 4:31:05 PM] Luc: Aha! How young are we talking?
[11/4/19, 4:31:35 PM] Luc: Was this part of what helped you decide you wanted to study English or did you go there already interested?
[11/4/19, 4:31:46 PM] Luc: Sorry about this delay I had a few meetings
[11/4/19, 4:31:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: No worries!
[11/4/19, 4:31:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: 17
[11/4/19, 4:32:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: I had already decided to study translation. But after the trip I had no doubts haha.
[11/4/19, 4:33:05 PM] Luc: I see
[11/4/19, 4:33:25 PM] Luc: And it helped you to develop one of those very funny Argentine British English accents I presume?
[11/4/19, 4:34:47 PM] Luc: Everyone says they prefer the British accent because of the way it sounds but I know the truth
[11/4/19, 4:34:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Noooo
[11/4/19, 4:34:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: I hate that
[11/4/19, 4:35:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs not British and everyone knows it
[11/4/19, 4:35:09 PM] Luc: Which is they just prefer not having to say our American R sound
[11/4/19, 4:37:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm closer to American. But people usually ask me where am I from. Like it sounds American but funny, I guess haha
[11/4/19, 4:38:35 PM] Luc: That's so hard
[11/4/19, 4:38:50 PM] Luc: I'll be very impressed if you've even got it halfway down
[11/4/19, 4:39:28 PM] Luc: My Spanish is also Argentine but funny. Some sounds I have zero problem, others I just can't
[11/4/19, 4:40:06 PM] Luc: So we could have half a conversation before a word with a specifc sound comes up and I slip and immediately I get "per√° de d√≥nde sos?"
[11/4/19, 4:40:30 PM] Luc: This silly G sound kills me
[11/4/19, 4:40:34 PM] Luc: Like in jengibre
[11/4/19, 4:40:51 PM] Luc: Anyway I'll let you be the judge of all that üò¨
[11/4/19, 4:47:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajaja
[11/4/19, 4:47:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm highly looking forward to that
[11/4/19, 4:47:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Both ways, clearly)
[11/4/19, 4:53:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Can I make use of your native English with a quick question? üòÖ
[11/4/19, 4:53:36 PM] Luc: Always
[11/4/19, 4:53:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: I have the word ‚Äúiteration‚Äù in a translation about a masters program. No idea what the hell it means in this context.
[11/4/19, 4:54:07 PM] Luc: It's an incremental version of something
[11/4/19, 4:54:46 PM] Luc: In software development we "iterate" on a feature, slowly adding to it and improving it with each iteration.
[11/4/19, 4:54:53 PM] Luc: Not sure what your context is but maybe that helps
[11/4/19, 4:55:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: I found the very same thing
[11/4/19, 4:55:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I‚Äôm not sure how it applies here
[11/4/19, 4:55:40 PM] Luc: An iteration of a master's program would likely refer to the fact that
[11/4/19, 4:55:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll show u
[11/4/19, 4:55:48 PM] Luc: Each year they change the curriculum
[11/4/19, 4:55:53 PM] Luc: But feel free to show me
[11/4/19, 4:56:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ahhh like an improvement of the previous one!
[11/4/19, 4:56:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: I got it
[11/4/19, 4:57:14 PM] Luc: Yeah but... improvement isn't really the word I'd use
[11/4/19, 4:57:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nono
[11/4/19, 4:57:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sure
[11/4/19, 4:57:22 PM] Luc: It's just different. Improvement isn't linear
[11/4/19, 4:57:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Now I have to find the way to say it in Spanish
[11/4/19, 4:57:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I got the idea
[11/4/19, 4:57:35 PM] Luc: Ideally each iteration is better but we live in the real world
[11/4/19, 4:57:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Like they added this new aspect
[11/4/19, 4:57:46 PM] Luc: Good luck let me know what you come up
[11/4/19, 4:58:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Thanks a lot!!
[11/4/19, 4:58:08 PM] Luc: I can tell you that when I worked at a software company they used iterar as a verb
[11/4/19, 4:58:19 PM] Luc: And iteraci√≥n as a noun
[11/4/19, 4:58:23 PM] Luc: Lol
[11/4/19, 4:58:39 PM] Luc: An Argentine* company
[11/4/19, 5:09:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah. Why having a language of our own if we can borrow all the words from another one, right? ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/4/19, 5:11:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/4/19, 5:15:28 PM] Luc: They did way too much of that
[11/4/19, 5:16:29 PM] Luc: "Che, tengo un after pero m√°ndame calendar y luego hacemos un sync y te doy todo los feedbacks"
[11/4/19, 5:16:34 PM] Luc: Feedbacks
[11/4/19, 5:16:42 PM] Luc: Ugh
[11/4/19, 5:38:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/4/19, 5:39:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: It happens in many many companies.
[11/4/19, 6:01:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: I end up saying something like ‚Äúel cual incorpora xxx a su curricula‚Äù. (Being ‚Äúxxx‚Äù the topic/subject added).
[11/4/19, 6:02:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I‚Äôll give it another try later, to see if I come up with a better alternative, I need it to rest haha.
[11/4/19, 6:23:38 PM] Luc: I think as long as you communicated the idea that should suffice well
[11/4/19, 6:27:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah. I‚Äôm probably too meticulous. It‚Äôs part of the job I guess haha.
[11/4/19, 6:27:58 PM] Luc: It's not a bad quality to have (:
[11/4/19, 6:32:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: At a normal level, probably it isn‚Äôt. üòÖ
[11/4/19, 6:33:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm not sure if it is because I‚Äôm talking with you but all the bands that popped up in my playlist just now are from California.
[11/4/19, 6:34:04 PM] Luc: Spotify is watching you :O
[11/4/19, 6:55:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: It issss
[11/4/19, 8:04:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: How was your rainy day?
[11/4/19, 8:04:36 PM] Luc: Hi there
[11/4/19, 8:04:40 PM] Luc: It was nice
[11/4/19, 8:04:43 PM] Luc: It was relaxing
[11/4/19, 8:05:02 PM] Luc: I was at home most of the day because my deliveries didn't come until like 7
[11/4/19, 8:05:13 PM] Luc: And I have a weird anxiety about missing deliveries hahahah
[11/4/19, 8:06:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/4/19, 8:07:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: But they arrived, right?
[11/4/19, 8:07:15 PM] Luc: Yeah üôåüèº
[11/4/19, 8:09:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Great üòÅ
[11/4/19, 8:09:14 PM] Luc: Yourself?
[11/4/19, 8:09:23 PM] Luc: Still at school? Work? Home?
[11/4/19, 8:09:51 PM] Luc: I have no idea where you are but I assume that, wherever it is you are tirelessly working at something
[11/4/19, 8:19:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/4/19, 8:20:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm at school. But I skipped the first class.
[11/4/19, 8:21:40 PM] Luc: REBEL
[11/4/19, 8:22:07 PM] Luc: Fuiste al patio a fumarte un fasito???
[11/4/19, 8:22:19 PM] Luc: This doesn't sound like the Anita I know
[11/4/19, 8:23:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Coffee. My kind of fasito
[11/4/19, 8:23:51 PM] Luc: Viciada this girl is
[11/4/19, 8:24:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: I already know that I‚Äôve passed the subject. That‚Äôs why.
[11/4/19, 8:25:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/4/19, 8:26:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah I know.. NERD!
[11/4/19, 8:27:47 PM] Luc: Sounds a lot like what I did honestly
[11/4/19, 8:27:55 PM] Luc: Showed up on test day
[11/4/19, 8:28:07 PM] Luc: Other than that did most of my learning on my own
[11/4/19, 8:33:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: And we have three mondays left only. One of which is a holiday. So.. it‚Äôs fine.
[11/4/19, 8:33:26 PM] Luc: Hey your secret is safe with me
[11/4/19, 8:38:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: the downside is that the next class ends at 11 üò¥
[11/4/19, 8:38:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm soooo sleepy right now
[11/4/19, 8:39:08 PM] Luc: How
[11/4/19, 8:39:11 PM] Luc: Do
[11/4/19, 8:39:13 PM] Luc: Like
[11/4/19, 8:39:14 PM] Luc: Why
[11/4/19, 8:39:17 PM] Luc: Clases until 11
[11/4/19, 8:39:21 PM] Luc: It's just insane
[11/4/19, 8:39:24 PM] Luc: To me
[11/4/19, 8:40:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Agreed
[11/4/19, 8:41:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: üò≠
[11/4/19, 8:41:40 PM] Luc: And tonight, you'll get home at what, 12?
[11/4/19, 8:41:54 PM] Luc: I'm going to do my very best not to keep you up the entire night I pinky promise
[11/4/19, 8:43:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha don‚Äôt! I highly appreciate the company on my way back. üòÖ
[11/4/19, 8:44:01 PM] Luc: Oh of course, it's my pleasure
[11/4/19, 8:44:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Thks ‚ò∫
[11/4/19, 8:45:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Any plans for tonight?
[11/4/19, 8:45:22 PM] Luc: None!
[11/4/19, 8:52:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: I highly envy you right now haha
[11/4/19, 8:52:31 PM] Luc: Welp
[11/4/19, 8:52:53 PM] Luc: Never too late to drop out and become a software consultant?
[11/4/19, 8:58:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I wouldn‚Äôt even know where to begin
[11/4/19, 9:01:59 PM] Luc: For me it was that
[11/4/19, 9:02:04 PM] Luc: We used to pirate a lot of music
[11/4/19, 9:02:17 PM] Luc: Really emotional indie rock specifically
[11/4/19, 9:02:27 PM] Luc: And we would share it with eachother on USB thumb drives
[11/4/19, 9:02:47 PM] Luc: And then a friend and I decided to see if there was a way we could host it on the *internet*
[11/4/19, 9:03:05 PM] Luc: Bold because we were like 12 and the internet was still just chat rooms with creepy dudes
[11/4/19, 9:03:39 PM] Luc: Long story short we did figure it out and made a neighborhood wide network where we shared movies and music all very illegally
[11/4/19, 9:03:56 PM] Luc: Until some letters came in the mail detailing copyright infringement and potential fines
[11/4/19, 9:04:01 PM] Luc: And we stopped right quick
[11/4/19, 9:04:18 PM] Luc: But after that the interest was born so
[11/4/19, 9:04:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/4/19, 9:05:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hell of a story!
[11/4/19, 9:05:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: I really need examples of this
[11/4/19, 9:06:10 PM] Luc: Well being from Portland
[11/4/19, 9:06:13 PM] Luc: It was
[11/4/19, 9:06:31 PM] Luc: Modest mouse, built to spill, arcade fire, Radiohead, flaming lips, etc.
[11/4/19, 9:06:45 PM] Luc: We were a bunch of really emotional teens
[11/4/19, 9:06:56 PM] Luc: Great music nonetheless though I don't listen much anymore
[11/4/19, 9:07:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha ok. I only know some of those. So I can‚Äôt judge.
‚Äé[11/4/19, 9:10:43 PM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/4/19, 10:44:24 PM] Luc: 15 more minutes you can do this üí™üèº
[11/4/19, 11:01:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yayyy
[11/4/19, 11:01:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm out
[11/4/19, 11:02:13 PM] Luc: üôåüèºüôåüèº
[11/4/19, 11:02:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Only one Monday left üôåüèº
[11/4/19, 11:02:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Your night?
‚Äé[11/4/19, 11:02:58 PM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/4/19, 11:03:06 PM] Luc: As√≠
[11/4/19, 11:13:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/4/19, 11:13:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Explain please
[11/4/19, 11:14:49 PM] Luc: Haha no i have nothing interesting to report
[11/4/19, 11:15:12 PM] Luc: I made a good polenta with some goat cheese and a piece of cuadril that I seared
[11/4/19, 11:15:28 PM] Luc: Now I'm looking at this old family photo album my mom sent me
[11/4/19, 11:15:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: That counts as interesting
[11/4/19, 11:16:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Specially for sb who is about to bite the bus seat any time soon.
[11/4/19, 11:16:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
‚Äé[11/4/19, 11:17:20 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/4/19, 11:17:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ohh. Is tiny six pack Luc there?
[11/4/19, 11:17:41 PM] Luc: Hahaha yes pre sixpack
[11/4/19, 11:17:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha thanks for the distraction
[11/4/19, 11:19:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Which sister is the one that got married?
[11/4/19, 11:19:34 PM] Luc: The middle
[11/4/19, 11:19:36 PM] Luc: Sandhya
[11/4/19, 11:19:44 PM] Luc: With the stunned look hahaha
[11/4/19, 11:20:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha and Bruce is hers?
[11/4/19, 11:21:15 PM] Luc: No Bruce is Jessica's
[11/4/19, 11:21:17 PM] Luc: The oldest
[11/4/19, 11:21:25 PM] Luc: With the big cute eyes
[11/4/19, 11:21:43 PM] Luc: Wearing the sticker which says Cynthia (my mom)
[11/4/19, 11:22:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Got it
[11/4/19, 11:23:11 PM] Luc: This photo is so Americana
[11/4/19, 11:23:16 PM] Luc: I love it
[11/4/19, 11:23:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Why do you say so?
[11/4/19, 11:23:50 PM] Luc: Like it's only missing some wonderbread and a station wagon in the background
[11/4/19, 11:23:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs a great photo!
[11/4/19, 11:26:34 PM] Luc: Thanks :)
[11/4/19, 11:26:40 PM] Luc: The Golden years
[11/4/19, 11:36:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry. Got to the bus stop where I change buses.
[11/4/19, 11:37:03 PM] Luc: Sorry for what!
[11/4/19, 11:37:08 PM] Luc: Do your thing girl
[11/4/19, 11:39:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: I apologize more than I should haha.
[11/4/19, 11:40:16 PM] Luc: Maybe you were Canadian in a past life? üòõ
[11/4/19, 11:40:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/4/19, 11:41:00 PM] Luc: So what class is this
[11/4/19, 11:41:07 PM] Luc: That goes until 11
[11/4/19, 11:41:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not a big maple syrup fan. That‚Äôs the only reason why I‚Äôm sure I wasn‚Äôt haha
[11/4/19, 11:41:54 PM] Luc: Nooo but it's yummy!
[11/4/19, 11:41:58 PM] Luc: Do you like honey?
[11/4/19, 11:42:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Subtitling and dubbing. At least it‚Äôs entertaining.
[11/4/19, 11:43:25 PM] Luc: So glad this isn't a dubbing country
[11/4/19, 11:43:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: I do. But I wouldn‚Äôt choose it in the first place probably (same thing with the syrup).
[11/4/19, 11:43:35 PM] Luc: Couldn't survive here if it were
[11/4/19, 11:44:00 PM] Luc: Brown sugar? White sugar? Stevia?
[11/4/19, 11:45:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Wait. I‚Äôm lost.
[11/4/19, 11:46:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: where would you put them? I was thinking of the syrup/honey over a pancake (born a fatty).
[11/4/19, 11:46:35 PM] Luc: Oh yeah
[11/4/19, 11:46:38 PM] Luc: I realize
[11/4/19, 11:46:51 PM] Luc: I was just thinking about honey
[11/4/19, 11:47:17 PM] Luc: And I remember you said you put sweetener in your coffee
[11/4/19, 11:48:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, not proud haha
[11/4/19, 11:48:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Couldn‚Äôt agree more
[11/4/19, 11:49:10 PM] Luc: Oh wanted to ask you before I forgot
[11/4/19, 11:49:21 PM] Luc: Which day works best for you, Friday or weekend?
[11/4/19, 11:49:56 PM] Luc: I have a friend who's having a birthday party Friday night but it wouldn't be until 8ish. So if you are thinking Friday afternoon that's great for me, or any time during the weekend :)
[11/4/19, 11:52:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm. How about Saturday? Cause I won‚Äôt be free from work that early on Friday (and I wouldn‚Äôt want to meet you in my uniform either haha).
[11/4/19, 11:52:43 PM] Luc: Saturday is perfect
[11/4/19, 11:53:00 PM] Luc: I don't have any plans other than to play soccer at 7pm
[11/4/19, 11:53:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: And I wouldn‚Äôt want to make you late for the birthday party either.
[11/4/19, 11:55:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: And do you do anything afterwards?
[11/4/19, 11:55:40 PM] Luc: With my soccer friends? No
[11/4/19, 11:55:46 PM] Luc: I usually just go home and shower hahah
[11/4/19, 11:56:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: I take a course on Saturdays. Usually in the morning, but they were talking about moving it to the afternoon this time. So I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be free before the game.
[11/4/19, 11:56:53 PM] Luc: Oooh a course
[11/4/19, 11:56:57 PM] Luc: Curious I am
[11/4/19, 11:57:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/4/19, 11:57:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Literature
[11/4/19, 11:57:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: And sociolinguistics
[11/4/19, 11:58:33 PM] Luc: Is your course here in the city?
[11/4/19, 11:58:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: It is. Deep Capital haha.
[11/4/19, 11:59:18 PM] Luc: Define deep?
[11/4/19, 11:59:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: In Floresta
[11/4/19, 11:59:22 PM] Luc: Oh
[11/4/19, 11:59:24 PM] Luc: Yeah
[11/5/19, 12:00:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: Shall we say Saturday night?
[11/5/19, 12:00:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: But you let me know if you are too tired after the game and we reschedule. No problem at all.
[11/5/19, 12:00:33 AM] Luc: Dia de espa√±ol comienza
[11/5/19, 12:00:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: Y paso a espa√±ol porque son las 12
[11/5/19, 12:00:39 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja eso
[11/5/19, 12:00:44 AM] Luc: üòòüòò
[11/5/19, 12:01:04 AM] Luc: S√°bado por la noche me parece genial
[11/5/19, 12:01:46 AM] Luc: El tema es que normalmente como algo antes de jugar para tener un poquito de energ√≠a, por eso me pinta tomar algo despues pero normalmente no tengo mucha hambre
[11/5/19, 12:02:07 AM] Luc: Tampoco quiero que tengas que quedarte en la ciudad esperando que yo termine con el partido
[11/5/19, 12:02:37 AM] Luc: Que opinas?
[11/5/19, 12:03:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Vuelvo a casa y voy a donde quedemos, olv√≠date por eso.
[11/5/19, 12:04:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: Y te encuentro para lo que te pinte tomar (ya cenada) jajaja.
[11/5/19, 12:04:06 AM] Luc: Porque sos tan buena?
[11/5/19, 12:04:57 AM] Luc: Ten√©s un bar preferido? Si no tengo muchos que me gustan
[11/5/19, 12:04:58 AM] Luc: Pero
[11/5/19, 12:05:11 AM] Luc: S√°bado es el d√©cimo?
[11/5/19, 12:05:34 AM] Anita Zuddio: Creo que es 9
[11/5/19, 12:05:54 AM] Luc: Ohhh sip ten√©s raz√≥n
[11/5/19, 12:06:00 AM] Luc: El 10 hay un evento de vinos
[11/5/19, 12:06:04 AM] Luc: Igual no importa :)
[11/5/19, 12:06:12 AM] Luc: D√©jame pensar un lugar
[11/5/19, 12:06:33 AM] Luc: Por ac√° tipo Palermo estar√≠a bien?
[11/5/19, 12:07:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: Esto es muuuuy amplio jajaja
[11/5/19, 12:07:51 AM] Luc: Dir√≠a Belgrano pero pasa que Belgrano por la noche est√° medio vac√≠o
[11/5/19, 12:08:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: Entro a casa y te contesto. One sec.
[11/5/19, 12:08:41 AM] Luc: üôÉ
[11/5/19, 12:11:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: Es cierto. Pero ojo que s√°bado puede ser buena opci√≥n.
[11/5/19, 12:11:43 AM] Anita Zuddio: Porque Palermo explota.
[11/5/19, 12:12:09 AM] Anita Zuddio: Igual puedo llegar a ambos si ten√≠as algo en mente jaja
[11/5/19, 12:12:17 AM] Luc: D√©jame pensarlo un poquito
[11/5/19, 12:12:40 AM] Luc: Y te doy unas opciones
[11/5/19, 12:12:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: Me encant√≥
[11/5/19, 12:12:50 AM] Luc: Y vos eligis, te parece?
[11/5/19, 12:13:25 AM] Luc: Yo prefiero no tener que gritar ni lugares super llenos, espero que est√©s de acuerdo üò∂
[11/5/19, 12:13:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Muy de acuerdo
[11/5/19, 12:13:51 AM] Luc: Perfecto
[11/5/19, 12:13:55 AM] Luc: Hecho entonces
[11/5/19, 12:14:27 AM] Luc: Ya est√°s cansada? Me imagino que s√≠
[11/5/19, 12:16:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: ‚ò∫üôåüèº
[11/5/19, 12:17:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: Muerta. Pero todav√≠a tengo que ver qu√© cenar y qu√© llevo para comer ma√±ana.
[11/5/19, 12:20:53 AM] Luc: D:
[11/5/19, 12:21:20 AM] Luc: Te dejo a arreglar las cosas, av√≠same
[11/5/19, 12:29:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: Todo resuelto
[11/5/19, 12:29:47 AM] Luc: Ya?
[11/5/19, 12:34:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sii jaja
[11/5/19, 12:34:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Por esto dejo la comida hecha el fin de semana
[11/5/19, 12:35:43 AM] Luc: Intento hacer lo mismo
[11/5/19, 12:36:01 AM] Luc: O una versi√≥n en la cual preparo un mont√≥n de cosas y las guardo separadas
[11/5/19, 12:36:45 AM] Luc: Despu√©s combinandolas de la forma que me pinta cuando tenga hambre
[11/5/19, 12:44:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: Es una muy buena idea
[11/5/19, 12:45:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Igual espero con ansias ya no tener facultad para poder cocinarme mas. Ahora es todo bastante repetitivo jaja
[11/5/19, 12:45:28 AM] Luc: As√≠ es la vida
[11/5/19, 12:45:33 AM] Luc: Lamentablemente
[11/5/19, 12:45:40 AM] Luc: Te aseguro que
[11/5/19, 12:45:48 AM] Luc: Una vez que termines
[11/5/19, 12:46:33 AM] Luc: Que surjan otras cosas a llenar tu tiempo.. ese mismo tiempo que hab√≠as esperado a ser libre
[11/5/19, 12:47:00 AM] Luc: No lo escrib√≠ bien
[11/5/19, 12:47:03 AM] Luc: Me ayudas?
[11/5/19, 12:48:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: Por supuesto
[11/5/19, 12:49:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: Dec√≠s que van a surgir otras cosas que llenen el tiempo que tanto hab√≠a esperado tener libre.
[11/5/19, 12:49:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: No?
[11/5/19, 12:49:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: Probablemente jaja
[11/5/19, 12:50:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ya notaste que no puedo estar mucho tiempo sin hacer nada, creo. No?
[11/5/19, 12:50:49 AM] Luc: Exacto, y gracias
[11/5/19, 12:51:04 AM] Luc: Un hecho de la vida
[11/5/19, 12:51:22 AM] Luc: Es una cuesti√≥n de adaptarte supongo
[11/5/19, 12:52:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: Seguro
[11/5/19, 12:53:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: Nada que agradecer
[11/5/19, 12:53:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: Se entend√≠a igual, eran detalles
[11/5/19, 12:54:58 AM] Luc: A la una dormimos?
[11/5/19, 12:55:00 AM] Luc: Hahah
[11/5/19, 12:56:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Si, por favor!
[11/5/19, 12:56:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Probablemente est√© en la cama un rato despu√©s de la una
[11/5/19, 12:56:51 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pero te dejo descansar tranquilo
[11/5/19, 12:57:00 AM] Luc: Ya estoy üò¥
[11/5/19, 12:57:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: Igual, si vamos a hacer d√≠a de espa√±ol, es hora de que adoptes el ‚Äújajaja‚Äù.
[11/5/19, 12:57:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: Me parece
[11/5/19, 12:57:24 AM] Luc: Nunca, sorry
[11/5/19, 12:58:04 AM] Luc: Ni vas a escuchar que "boludo/a" salga de mi boca
[11/5/19, 12:58:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Val√≠a el intento jaja
[11/5/19, 12:59:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: Esta bien igual, te ser√≠a muy poco natural.
[11/5/19, 12:59:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: Es entendible
[11/5/19, 12:59:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: No te detengo m√°s
[11/5/19, 12:59:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: Descans√° ‚ò∫
[11/5/19, 12:59:33 AM] Luc: Sigo leyendo ja ja con J ingl√©s
[11/5/19, 1:01:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja quiero que lo leas en vivo
[11/5/19, 1:01:52 AM] Anita Zuddio: Puede ser muy divertido
[11/5/19, 1:02:01 AM] Luc: üôä
[11/5/19, 1:02:10 AM] Luc: Alg√∫n d√≠a :)
[11/5/19, 1:02:12 AM] Luc: Bueno

[11/5/19, 1:02:56 AM] Anita Zuddio: Nada que agradecer (:
[11/5/19, 1:02:56 AM] Luc: Espero que descanses y que no me odies por otra vez haberte quedado despierta hasta tarde
[11/5/19, 1:03:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: Para nada
[11/5/19, 1:03:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: Gracias por acompa√±arme el regreso! (sino me dorm√≠a en el colectivo y soy un peligro)

[11/5/19, 10:53:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja me parece muy bien.
[11/5/19, 3:19:33 PM] Luc: Buenas :) como te va todo?
[11/5/19, 3:27:31 PM] Luc: Mis bares favoritos son Rey de Copas, Boticario, y Club Lucero. Para tener una selecci√≥n de vinos voy normalmente a Hache o Trova. Otras opciones hay tambi√©n, Uptown, Victoria Brown, y m√°s :)
[11/5/19, 3:27:39 PM] Luc: Estar√© feliz en cualquiera
[11/5/19, 4:21:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hola! Perd√≥n. Con un d√≠a de locos en el trabajo.
[11/5/19, 4:22:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm hay algunos que no ubico, otros si. Pero dejame chusmearlos y te digo. üòÅ

[11/5/19, 5:39:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que lindo! Eso es desde donde tienes tu oficina?
[11/5/19, 5:40:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ahora mejor! üòÅ

[11/5/19, 5:41:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sale a Zabala ese puente, no?
[11/5/19, 5:42:05 PM] Luc: Exacto
[11/5/19, 5:42:20 PM] Luc: Llegando a colegiales desde zona norte
‚Äé[11/5/19, 5:42:49 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/5/19, 5:43:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Las casas en esa zona son muuuuy lindas
[11/5/19, 5:43:56 PM] Luc: Hay algunas embajadas
[11/5/19, 5:44:01 PM] Luc: La de Australia
[11/5/19, 5:44:05 PM] Luc: Alemania
[11/5/19, 5:44:37 PM] Luc: Cuando vino Einstein a visitar se qued√≥ en la casa que ahora es la embajada Australiana
[11/5/19, 5:44:49 PM] Luc: Super linda. La paso en un cachito
[11/5/19, 5:46:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me gust√≥ ese dato!
[11/5/19, 5:46:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Y me intriga enormemente como sabes jaja
[11/5/19, 5:47:21 PM] Luc: No soy tan listo. Hay una placa üòâüòâ
[11/5/19, 5:48:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja si no dec√≠as nada, pasabas por listo
[11/5/19, 5:51:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me est√° costando elegir jajaja
‚Äé[11/5/19, 5:54:43 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/5/19, 5:56:13 PM] Luc: Bueno, no hay apuro :)
[11/5/19, 5:56:34 PM] Luc: Y si al fin no quer√©s elegir, elijo yo haha
[11/5/19, 5:57:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es que hace rato quiero conocer boticario y uptown (de los que nombraste). Pero s√°bado tengo miedo de que est√©n llenos de gente.
[11/5/19, 5:57:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: ü§î
[11/5/19, 5:58:15 PM] Luc: Uptown s√≠
[11/5/19, 5:58:18 PM] Luc: Boticario no tanto
[11/5/19, 5:59:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm tempting
[11/5/19, 6:00:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Entre boticario y alguno de los de vinos, cu√°l elegir√≠as?
[11/5/19, 6:01:14 PM] Luc: Boticario me copa
[11/5/19, 6:01:31 PM] Luc: El tem√°tico m√°s que nada
[11/5/19, 6:11:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pase muchas veces por la puerta pero nunca fui.
[11/5/19, 6:11:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me copa
[11/5/19, 6:34:29 PM] Luc: Hecho :)
[11/5/19, 7:34:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yay! üôåüèº
[11/5/19, 7:34:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: No te puedo explicar el nivel de sue√±o que manejo
[11/5/19, 7:34:54 PM] Luc: Que pas√≥? No dormiste bien?
[11/5/19, 7:34:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Para, me quedo una duda picando. Todos los d√≠as andas por ah√≠? O fue hoy?
[11/5/19, 7:35:30 PM] Luc: Las fotos fueron al momento! Voy caminando todos los d√≠as, pero no siempre en ese barrio
[11/5/19, 7:36:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me est√°n faltando horas de sue√±o. Muchas jaja.
[11/5/19, 7:36:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ahhh esta bien
[11/5/19, 7:36:38 PM] Luc: Y hoy en el trabajo, algo sucedi√≥?
[11/5/19, 7:36:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Vas variando el recorrido
[11/5/19, 7:36:47 PM] Luc: Exacto!
[11/5/19, 7:37:04 PM] Luc: Para que vaya conociendo mejor la ciudad

[11/5/19, 7:59:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Tanto por un maniqu√≠??? jajaja
[11/5/19, 8:00:22 PM] Luc: Tanta drama
[11/5/19, 8:01:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Posta! Es un maniqu√≠iii
[11/5/19, 8:01:42 PM] Luc: Est√° jodido el tipo
[11/5/19, 8:01:49 PM] Luc: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[11/5/19, 8:09:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: TRAVEL BAN?!
[11/5/19, 8:09:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es un mont√≥n!
[11/5/19, 8:10:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sabes a que comediante es que vieron?
[11/5/19, 8:17:17 PM] Luc: Se llama Tony
[11/5/19, 8:17:29 PM] Luc: Es lo unico que se
[11/5/19, 8:28:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me intriga jaja
[11/5/19, 8:28:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: En clase est√°n dando una presentaci√≥n sobre costumbres argentinas. Y explican en ingl√©s como cebar mate
[11/5/19, 8:28:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Muy divertido jaja
[11/5/19, 8:30:07 PM] Luc: Awww haha les estan preparando a ser buenos embajadores
[11/5/19, 9:07:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Te estaba escribiendo en ingl√©s porque estoy hablando en ingl√©s ac√°.
[11/5/19, 9:07:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero me acord√© que sigue siendo d√≠a de espa√±ol jaja
[11/5/19, 9:08:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ellas tuvieron que hablar sobre dulce de leche. Yo sobre m√∫sica cl√°sica del siglo 20. Not fair at all!
[11/5/19, 9:11:10 PM] Luc: Hahahahahah
[11/5/19, 9:11:18 PM] Luc: Un poco aburrido el asunto
[11/5/19, 9:13:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Un poco???
[11/5/19, 9:14:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: esa debe haber sido la raz√≥n por la que tuve sue√±o todo el d√≠a
[11/5/19, 9:19:36 PM] Luc: Hahaha entiendo
[11/5/19, 9:19:56 PM] Luc: Otra vez ten√©s clase hasta las 11?
[11/5/19, 9:20:39 PM] Luc: Me estoy juntando con un amigo a tomar algo, pero luego te mando un mensaje si no es tan tarde :)
[11/5/19, 9:20:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: 10
[11/5/19, 9:21:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que bien!
[11/5/19, 9:21:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Have fun!
[11/5/19, 9:21:08 PM] Luc: Menos mal
[11/5/19, 9:21:14 PM] Luc: Gracias!
[11/6/19, 8:41:12 AM] Luc: Hello and good morning :)
[11/6/19, 8:43:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Morning!
[11/6/19, 8:43:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: How was ur night out?
[11/6/19, 8:46:10 AM] Luc: It was nice actually I hadn't been to this bar before and it was pretty cool!
[11/6/19, 8:46:20 AM] Luc: How about yours?
[11/6/19, 9:30:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: Cool. Which bar was it?
[11/6/19, 9:30:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: It was ok. I fell asleep in my sofa and moved to bed around 2.30 üòÖ
[11/6/19, 9:31:56 AM] Luc: Parque Bar Botanico, heard of it?
[11/6/19, 9:32:07 AM] Luc: I've done this more times than I'd like to admit üòõ
[11/6/19, 9:33:49 AM] Luc: I made the mistake a few weeks ago of mentioning to my friend in passing that I had more project offers than I could accept, and he has been basically harassing me to get drinks and discuss opening  that business here and hiring Argentine developers
[11/6/19, 9:35:21 AM] Luc: So I had to spend a while basically refuting a bit of his enthusiasm. He sees the peso tanking and thinks that means prices are going down (yes they are), I see it tanking and I think it's the market reflecting political and economic instability.
[11/6/19, 9:35:31 AM] Luc: Anyway I appreciated his enthusiasm :)
[11/6/19, 9:50:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah! A friend has been telling us that we should go for a while now. Ver good drinks, I understand.
[11/6/19, 9:50:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: Same!
[11/6/19, 9:51:20 AM] Anita Zuddio: ‚ÄúRefuting his enthusiasm‚Äù was a really good way to put it haha
[11/6/19, 9:57:21 AM] Luc: (:
[11/6/19, 9:57:34 AM] Luc: Maybe some time in the future it will make more sense
[11/6/19, 10:34:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: Any news from the mannequin?
[11/6/19, 10:34:41 AM] Luc: HAHAH
[11/6/19, 10:34:51 AM] Luc: No but I remembered something
[11/6/19, 10:34:57 AM] Luc: Who Tony was
[11/6/19, 10:35:30 AM] Luc: Or at least, the Tony that I met and spent a while talking to, a british man who approached me to chat because he too had a moustache and wanted to have a conversation about moustaches.
[11/6/19, 10:35:48 AM] Luc: He was a serious sweetheart though so I doubt it was he who dismembered that poor mannequin
[11/6/19, 10:35:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt get to tell you. But I loved that Argentine Spanish of yours haha.
[11/6/19, 10:36:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/6/19, 10:36:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: I can‚Äôt still believe that story.
[11/6/19, 10:36:52 AM] Luc: ü•¥
[11/6/19, 10:37:57 AM] Luc: Yesterday no me sali√≥ very well but I appreciate it either way. Like I said I have a weird accent. Sort of like an Argentine who grew up with French parents and needs to pause a lot.
[11/6/19, 10:38:13 AM] Luc: I was instructed "not to forward" this but I think it's safe with you
‚Äé[11/6/19, 10:38:20 AM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/6/19, 10:40:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: Head and torso are missing
[11/6/19, 10:40:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: This is amazing
[11/6/19, 10:40:30 AM] Luc: Best part of this note is that the writer used the phrase "mad pissed" which I haven't heard since... 2007? That's the kind of phrase you'd find on an album of Smash Mouth or Barenaked Ladies üòÇ
[11/6/19, 10:40:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: Thanks for that. It is, don‚Äôt worry.
[11/6/19, 10:40:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja
[11/6/19, 10:41:05 AM] Anita Zuddio: Or by a non-native trying too hard to sound native.
[11/6/19, 10:41:27 AM] Luc: Yeah it's such an odd note isn't it?
[11/6/19, 10:41:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve probably done that more than once
[11/6/19, 10:41:37 AM] Luc: Some weirdly misplaced words but also some very native-esque phrasing
[11/6/19, 10:45:24 AM] Luc: If you're curious I'm referring to "emphasize on" (on is not necessary), "you were in the party" (you were _at_ the party), "if you have it" (referring to _info_ as _it_ is really odd phrasing)
[11/6/19, 10:47:06 AM] Luc: but then you have "lurking," "mad pissed," "your crew," and "Whatsapp" used as a verb which all appear to me to show a really high level of exposure to spoken English
[11/6/19, 10:47:11 AM] Luc: Okay, analysis over :)
[11/6/19, 10:48:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha totally agreed
[11/6/19, 10:48:54 AM] Anita Zuddio: Info as it sounds odd cause information is uncountable. (Grammar nerd detected)
[11/6/19, 10:49:10 AM] Luc: right, in this case you'd say "if you have any"
[11/6/19, 10:49:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly
[11/6/19, 10:49:36 AM] Luc: But in spanish you guys use info as singular and plural which always throws me off
[11/6/19, 10:49:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: True
[11/6/19, 10:50:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: And in everyday expressions that make it even more confusing
[11/6/19, 10:51:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Like, if sb is telling you too many things at the same time in the morning (Quite annoying). You might say ‚Äúcu√°nta info‚Äù
[11/6/19, 10:51:39 AM] Anita Zuddio: Meaning: calm down, is way too early for this.
[11/6/19, 10:52:04 AM] Luc: Are you referring to this morning analysis? Am I giving you _cu√°nta info_?
[11/6/19, 10:52:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/6/19, 10:52:21 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not at all
[11/6/19, 10:53:41 AM] Luc: yeah
[11/6/19, 10:53:44 AM] Luc: as well as
[11/6/19, 10:53:49 AM] Luc: informaciones is a word
[11/6/19, 10:54:18 AM] Luc: informations is not
[11/6/19, 10:54:25 AM] Luc: is that not basically the crux of this issue?
[11/6/19, 10:56:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm yes and no
[11/6/19, 10:56:56 AM] Anita Zuddio: We wouldn‚Äôt use informaciones
[11/6/19, 10:59:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: Datos would probably be the word we use in plural (depending on the context, of course)
[11/6/19, 11:02:09 AM] Luc: Yup you're 100% right
[11/6/19, 11:03:07 AM] Luc: Sometimes when I'm confused about a word or how it's commonly used, I just search on my whatsapp to see how my friends have used it in conversations, and I just did that and info is literally never informaciones
[11/6/19, 11:09:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: You may have found it anyway tho
[11/6/19, 11:09:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: People don‚Äôt speak properly haha
[11/6/19, 11:10:27 AM] Luc: That's sort of the joy and pain of a language though isn't it?
[11/6/19, 11:18:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Certainly
[11/6/19, 11:18:55 AM] Anita Zuddio: Though it‚Äôs not that joyful when you have to translate a not so well written text. üòÖ
[11/6/19, 3:54:17 PM] Luc: Hahaha yes I can imagine, but I'm sure you do it impeccably regardless
[11/6/19, 4:20:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha not so sure about that. But thanks üòÖ

[11/6/19, 4:34:04 PM] Luc: Awww look at this unity
[11/6/19, 4:34:25 PM] Luc: What is this gorgeous handwriting you have
‚Äé[11/6/19, 4:37:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚ÄéGIF omitted
[11/6/19, 4:39:45 PM] Luc: Hahaha
[11/6/19, 4:52:24 PM] Luc: Adam Levine
[11/6/19, 4:52:36 PM] Luc: Is such an annoying judge
[11/6/19, 4:52:50 PM] Luc: Makes the show almost unwatchable
[11/6/19, 4:52:59 PM] Luc: Controversial opinion there ya go
[11/6/19, 4:57:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/6/19, 4:57:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: You will need to be more clear. Why does he annoy you?
[11/6/19, 5:00:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Apart form the fact that he interrupts all the others when they are saying something haha
[11/6/19, 5:02:27 PM] Luc: If you have a crush on him we can agree to disagree but my thesis would be
[11/6/19, 5:02:41 PM] Luc: I dislike Adam Levine because he acts like a 12 year old.
‚Äé[11/6/19, 5:02:59 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/6/19, 5:06:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh that looks so good!
[11/6/19, 5:07:25 PM] Luc: I wait all year for peach season
[11/6/19, 5:07:31 PM] Luc: There is no better fruit
[11/6/19, 5:07:34 PM] Luc: I said it
[11/6/19, 5:07:40 PM] Luc: Afternoon of controversial opinions
[11/6/19, 5:07:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha not a crush, but I don‚Äôt dislike him shall we say. I do listen to Maroon 5.
[11/6/19, 5:08:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/6/19, 5:08:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mango
[11/6/19, 5:08:13 PM] Luc: Songs about Jane was one of my first ever CDs and it's absolutely fantastic
[11/6/19, 5:08:31 PM] Luc: Then they got very poppy and I fell off the fan wagon
[11/6/19, 5:10:49 PM] Luc: I can deal with this but only the palmer(I think) kind that doesn't get stuck in the teeth
[11/6/19, 5:10:59 PM] Luc: Ever had a Mango Lassi?
[11/6/19, 5:22:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Had to google it. Must admit.
[11/6/19, 5:23:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nope, never. But it looks great. And anything edible that comes from India is amazing, so..
[11/6/19, 7:31:58 PM] Luc: They're crazy good.
[11/6/19, 7:33:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: You better know how to prepare one of those. Cause now I wanna try them and I don‚Äôt believe they are easy to find here.
[11/6/19, 7:34:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/6/19, 7:34:33 PM] Luc: I'll have to ask my dad or grandmother or stepmom but I think I could figure it out without too much fuss
[11/6/19, 7:35:32 PM] Luc: Either way they're amazing and a relatively agreeable introduction to Indian culture as opposed to giving you something crazy spicy hahaha
[11/6/19, 7:38:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Didn‚Äôt expect that answer haha.
[11/6/19, 7:38:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nooo.
[11/6/19, 7:41:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Spicy food fan here
[11/6/19, 8:23:50 PM] Luc: We'll see about this :)
[11/6/19, 8:25:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha why?
[11/6/19, 8:27:17 PM] Luc: It's an exponential scale
[11/6/19, 8:27:56 PM] Luc: Logarithmic really
[11/6/19, 8:28:02 PM] Luc: Which means nothing other than
[11/6/19, 8:28:20 PM] Luc: Something might be 10,000 times spicier than anything you've tried and that's not uncommon
[11/6/19, 8:28:56 PM] Luc: And humans in general don't have a good way of understanding what 10000x feels like
[11/6/19, 8:29:22 PM] Luc: Either way! None of this is particularly important. That you'd be curious to try is nice on its own
[11/6/19, 8:32:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôll give it a try again in a while üòÇ
[11/6/19, 8:35:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÅüòÅ
[11/6/19, 8:36:30 PM] Luc: Hahaha no worries
[11/6/19, 8:36:34 PM] Luc: How's school?

‚Äé[11/6/19, 8:48:31 PM] Luc: ‚Äéaudio omitted
[11/6/19, 9:50:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ohh. Not cool.
[11/6/19, 9:51:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Guess that‚Äôs the downside of living in a different time zone from your clients. Right?
[11/6/19, 10:09:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Why would you thank me for the audio? hahaha. I really enjoyed listening to you. So you can rant as much as you want here. (:
[11/6/19, 10:18:30 PM] Luc: Yeah unfortunately :/
[11/6/19, 10:18:42 PM] Luc: Cause I dunno! I get nervous leaving audios.
[11/6/19, 10:25:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I generally delete the first attempts. So I get you.
[11/6/19, 10:26:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Are you watching something? I don‚Äôt wanna interrupt you.
[11/6/19, 10:26:43 PM] Luc: No!
[11/6/19, 10:26:46 PM] Luc: Heading home?
[11/6/19, 10:27:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. On the second bus already. üôåüèº
[11/6/19, 10:27:37 PM] Luc: How was your day?
[11/6/19, 10:34:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: It was good. Nothing worth mentioning I think haha. Long and tiring, but I can‚Äôt complain.
[11/6/19, 10:36:55 PM] Luc: I imagin√©
[11/6/19, 10:37:11 PM] Luc: I dunno how you do it for 5 days straight! üò∂
[11/6/19, 10:37:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: You have been hearing me complain about how tired I am since we started chatting, I‚Äôm sorry! I‚Äôm not always like this haha.
[11/6/19, 10:37:40 PM] Luc: Doesn't bother me one bit honestly
[11/6/19, 10:39:05 PM] Luc: What are you gonna do once you're home?
[11/6/19, 10:39:18 PM] Luc: Shower, eat, iron, sleep?
[11/6/19, 10:39:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: These are my very last weeks of school. Fun Ani will be back soon haha.
[11/6/19, 10:40:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Probably eat, iron, sleep. I had to change my routine and shower in the morning. It wakes me up haha.
[11/6/19, 10:40:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Did you have a good day in spite of the late meeting?
[11/6/19, 10:41:49 PM] Luc: Fun Ani!
[11/6/19, 10:41:56 PM] Luc: Hahaha
[11/6/19, 10:42:06 PM] Luc: Which Ani do I get to meet on Saturday?
[11/6/19, 10:42:47 PM] Luc: Yeah totally, a really nice day
[11/6/19, 10:42:56 PM] Luc: Wednesdays are always good for some reason
[11/6/19, 10:44:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Fun Ani, clearly. I‚Äôll nap hard before we meet.
[11/6/19, 10:46:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm reeeeally looking forward to some good drinks and a good laugh. Hope you are too.
[11/6/19, 10:46:43 PM] Luc: Hahahaha I'm glad to hear that
[11/6/19, 10:47:07 PM] Luc: Yeah! Minus the laugh. I hate laughing. And humor. And fun in general.
[11/6/19, 10:47:30 PM] Luc: But totally happy to talk about 20th century music?
[11/6/19, 10:48:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha absolutely. Ready to hear about the implementation of multitrack recording in 1955?
[11/6/19, 10:48:47 PM] Luc: Actually yes
[11/6/19, 10:48:59 PM] Luc: That sounds sort of like something I'd enjoy üôä
[11/6/19, 10:49:04 PM] Luc: Hahah don't hate me
[11/6/19, 10:50:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not at all haha
[11/6/19, 10:50:34 PM] Luc: They used to literally use a big stereophone right? To capture sound?
[11/6/19, 10:51:10 PM] Luc: And to be able to manipulate the loudness of instruments (which all played at the same time), the musicians had to be closer or further from that big recording device
[11/6/19, 10:51:32 PM] Luc: Honestly ridiculously interesting but I'm gonna spare you the post-10pm nerd attack
[11/6/19, 10:53:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly. Multitrack recording allowed much more experimentation. In fact, that‚Äôs when the fusion of rhythms appears.
[11/6/19, 10:54:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: I honestly didn‚Äôt do as much research as I would have wanted to. So I don‚Äôt know if I will be able to go any deeper haha.
[11/6/19, 10:55:01 PM] Luc: Did you happen go as far as to research the MPC and the way that it particularly revolutionized hip-hop beats?
[11/6/19, 10:56:03 PM] Luc: That's a nice chapter of the story but definitely a bit more obscure
[11/6/19, 10:58:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt. You just don‚Äôt say things like that to a nerd and curious person haha. Of course now I will.
[11/6/19, 11:01:01 PM] Luc: Oh this is by far the coolest thing to me as a big fan of 90s hip hop when all of this was flourishing
[11/6/19, 11:01:23 PM] Luc: And they were basically learning they could sample bits and pieces of so many different genres
[11/6/19, 11:02:01 PM] Luc: I will talk too much about this and I don't want to right now, so tell me about you
[11/6/19, 11:02:07 PM] Luc: How's the Vicente Lopez life
[11/6/19, 11:03:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/6/19, 11:04:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: You definitely will
[11/6/19, 11:04:09 PM] Luc: üôäüôä
[11/6/19, 11:04:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: I meant on Saturday.. you got my attention.
[11/6/19, 11:04:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/6/19, 11:07:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs really nice. There aren‚Äôt any tall buildings. And there are many beautiful houses. So it‚Äôs really nice. And you have the river a few blocks away only.
[11/6/19, 11:08:32 PM] Luc: Do you rent or own your place?
[11/6/19, 11:10:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: A bit of both. It‚Äôs my uncle‚Äôs. So I pay him the rent but it‚Äôs symbolical, I definitely don‚Äôt pay what it should cost.
[11/6/19, 11:12:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: I can‚Äôt put into words how much I love my apartment. It‚Äôs old. But I think I got the best out of it.
[11/6/19, 11:13:46 PM] Luc: That's a really nice deal, good that you had that option and that you took advantage of it
[11/6/19, 11:13:53 PM] Luc: Think you'll stay there for a long time?
[11/6/19, 11:14:24 PM] Luc: Old apartments have a lot of charm (and problems, just ask my poor termotanque)
[11/6/19, 11:17:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: What happened to your termotanque?
[11/6/19, 11:18:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: I really don‚Äôt know. But I wouldn‚Äôt mind staying at all.
[11/6/19, 11:18:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs nice to feel like this in your own place I guess.
[11/6/19, 11:19:13 PM] Luc: It's less exciting than you'd expect (and why would anyone expect a termotanque story to be exciting?). Just the enchufe was actually not working consistently/properly, so sometimes he would turn on and heat up and work, and other times not at all and I assumed he was totally broken and said a _lot_ of hurtful things to him before I ultimately fixed the enchufe and the ficha and now we're on good speaking terms again.
[11/6/19, 11:20:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha good to hear that you made up with him.
[11/6/19, 11:20:58 PM] Luc: If you don't anthropomorphize your termotanque you're not human.
[11/6/19, 11:21:04 PM] Luc: Here's some fun trivia for you
[11/6/19, 11:21:18 PM] Luc: In the states do you know what we call a termotanque?
[11/6/19, 11:21:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmmm. Not a clue.
[11/6/19, 11:22:08 PM] Luc: Well I'm glad cause it makes no sense
[11/6/19, 11:22:13 PM] Luc: We call it a "hot water heater"
[11/6/19, 11:22:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Does it include ‚Äúheating‚Äù?
[11/6/19, 11:22:27 PM] Luc: I think you can quickly figure out why that name is redundant and silly
[11/6/19, 11:22:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Heater. Close enough.
[11/6/19, 11:22:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I can
[11/6/19, 11:22:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Why on earth would you heat hot water?
[11/6/19, 11:23:07 PM] Luc: lol
[11/6/19, 11:23:26 PM] Luc: "I could care less" falls in the same bucket
[11/6/19, 11:26:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I really like how much you analyzed it
[11/6/19, 11:28:13 PM] Luc: American idiosyncracies
[11/6/19, 11:28:29 PM] Luc: I miss my country maybe 1 day per month
[11/6/19, 11:28:35 PM] Luc: Today was that day
‚Äé[11/6/19, 11:32:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéaudio omitted
[11/6/19, 11:33:01 PM] Luc: no worries!
[11/6/19, 11:33:44 PM] Luc: I will give you a proper answer on saturday because like everything it's a somewhat lengthy story
[11/6/19, 11:36:15 PM] Luc: I miss my family! That's the big one and the important one.
[11/6/19, 11:36:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Fair enough
[11/6/19, 11:38:05 PM] Luc: And this is sort of weird but I hope you understand, I get really mentally exhausted by how many options there are for everything here. I always feel like no matter what I spend my money on I'm making a mistake because there are a million other versions that might have been cheaper/better. It's such a weird sensation, decision fatigue.
[11/6/19, 11:42:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Do you feel that here more than in the US? That‚Äôs curious.
[11/6/19, 11:42:17 PM] Luc: I'll tell you on saturday why and how I ended up here. But for now I'll mention that one thing I learned while here that I didn't expect is to just live with uncertainty. I think most people in our age who are Argentine grew up in a relatively unstable economic and sociopolitical environment, so it's just a natural condition. For me it was never that way and it was a cultural shock for me.
[11/6/19, 11:42:25 PM] Luc: Oh so, so much more so yes
[11/6/19, 11:42:36 PM] Luc: I could give you a lot of examples.
[11/6/19, 11:43:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs true. And kind of tiring as well. The constant uncertainty/instability.
[11/6/19, 11:44:46 PM] Luc: For real, but like almost everything in life you adapt. Now I go home and I sort of miss the chaos, I don't know what to do with myself because everything is so... easy
[11/6/19, 11:46:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: That must be nice. For a while at least haha.
[11/6/19, 11:49:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: But it‚Äôs true. I guess we also develop some ‚Äúabilities‚Äù that we wouldn‚Äôt otherwise.
[11/6/19, 11:50:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: You must try to understand where the country is standing and try to forsee what may happen in the short term. And base your decisions on that.
[11/6/19, 11:51:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt know if it came out as I expected haha.
[11/6/19, 11:52:25 PM] Luc: A very thoughtful response
[11/6/19, 11:52:38 PM] Luc: I'm gonna stay here for the foreseeable future
[11/6/19, 11:53:15 PM] Luc: Things were never going amazingly but before the elections I was considering buying an apartment here so I could always come back to summers at least, even if I wanted to move back home to the USA
[11/6/19, 11:53:46 PM] Luc: After the elections I'm frankly a bit scared that things might get worse and that investing here wouldn't really be a prudent decision
[11/6/19, 11:53:50 PM] Luc: So.. holding pattern
[11/6/19, 11:56:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Wise of you
[11/7/19, 12:00:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: I just got tickets for my holidays but I had been putting it off for a while, cause I don‚Äôt know where the hell we are gonna be by March. It sucks.
[11/7/19, 12:00:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: Eso ya ten√≠a que decirlo en espa√±ol. Mala m√≠a jaja.
[11/7/19, 12:01:43 AM] Luc: eso que quiere decir? a donde vas?
[11/7/19, 12:02:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: Colombia
[11/7/19, 12:02:53 AM] Luc: que bueno!!
[11/7/19, 12:03:17 AM] Luc: con toda la familia?
[11/7/19, 12:03:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Me refer√≠a a que si el d√≥lar se dispara otra vez. Todo me va a costar el triple para el momento de viajar ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/7/19, 12:03:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: Con mi prima nada m√°s.
[11/7/19, 12:03:58 AM] Anita Zuddio: Somos compa√±eras de aventuras, como solemos decir jaja
[11/7/19, 12:04:39 AM] Luc: ahh perdon, ahora entiendo
[11/7/19, 12:04:55 AM] Luc: dijiste "my holidays" no "the holidays," pense que hablabas de la navidad
[11/7/19, 12:05:20 AM] Luc: y tu prima, cuantos tiene?
[11/7/19, 12:15:06 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pude ser m√°s clara, perd√≥n
[11/7/19, 12:15:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jaja
[11/7/19, 12:15:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: 28
[11/7/19, 12:15:59 AM] Luc: nono, fuiste clara, lo le√≠ mal :)
[11/7/19, 12:16:57 AM] Luc: ya tenes itinerario para colombia?
[11/7/19, 12:18:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: Una vaga idea nada m√°s. De los destinos.
[11/7/19, 12:18:50 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pero no mucho
[11/7/19, 12:19:24 AM] Luc: prefer√≠s viajar as√≠, mas espont√°neamente?
[11/7/19, 12:20:02 AM] Anita Zuddio: Nooo, para nada. Ayer sacamos los pasajes reci√©n. Por eso no tengo nada. But I will jaja.
[11/7/19, 12:20:29 AM] Luc: aha :)
[11/7/19, 12:20:44 AM] Luc: cumpl√≠s en marzo, no?
[11/7/19, 12:21:42 AM] Luc: cumplir√°s a√±os all√°?
[11/7/19, 12:25:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: Casi. El 1ro de abril.
[11/7/19, 12:25:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: Quer√≠a pasarlo all√°, pero tengo que estar trabajando para esa fecha.
[11/7/19, 12:26:27 AM] Luc: Aw
[11/7/19, 12:26:41 AM] Luc: April fools day üò≤
[11/7/19, 12:27:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja por suerte ac√° se festeja el 28 de diciembre.
[11/7/19, 12:27:23 AM] Luc: No sab√≠a!!
[11/7/19, 12:27:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: Bah, no se festeja. Pero es ese d√≠a.
[11/7/19, 12:27:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: Me entendiste
[11/7/19, 12:27:46 AM] Luc: Lol
[11/7/19, 12:28:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ac√° el 1 de abril es el d√≠a del traductor, aunque no lo creas üòÇ
[11/7/19, 12:28:22 AM] Luc: Noooo
[11/7/19, 12:28:25 AM] Luc: Que suerte!
[11/7/19, 12:28:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Meant to be
[11/7/19, 12:28:39 AM] Anita Zuddio: Cuando es el tuyo?
[11/7/19, 12:28:41 AM] Luc: Te festejamos doblemente
[11/7/19, 12:28:55 AM] Luc: 21/3
[11/7/19, 12:41:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: üòÅ
[11/7/19, 12:42:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: No tiene nada que ver, pero me surgi√≥ la duda de ver c√≥mo escribiste la fecha.
[11/7/19, 12:42:37 AM] Luc: Hahahaha!
[11/7/19, 12:42:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Te cost√≥ acostumbrarte al cambio d√≠a/mes?
[11/7/19, 12:42:50 AM] Luc: Y las horas tambi√©n?
[11/7/19, 12:43:02 AM] Luc: Nah no porque
[11/7/19, 12:43:30 AM] Luc: Siempre usamos ISO en mi trabajo que representa fechas como string de DD-MM-YYYY
[11/7/19, 12:44:15 AM] Luc: Es m√°s o menos la notaci√≥n universal
[11/7/19, 12:44:57 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ahhh buen punto
[11/7/19, 12:45:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: No lo sab√≠a
[11/7/19, 12:45:34 AM] Luc: Pero las horas s√≠, todav√≠a me parece raro ver "18.30hs" y no "6:30pm"
[11/7/19, 12:50:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: Claro, no pens√© en eso
[11/7/19, 12:50:43 AM] Anita Zuddio: Igual podes encontrarlo de las dos maneras creo.
[11/7/19, 12:51:05 AM] Luc: A veces!
[11/7/19, 12:51:10 AM] Luc: Estoy muerto
[11/7/19, 12:51:22 AM] Luc: Creo que voy a üò¥
[11/7/19, 12:52:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: No te detengo m√°s!

[11/7/19, 9:16:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Buen d√≠a!
[11/7/19, 9:16:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Igualmente para vos!
[11/7/19, 9:17:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: Me segu√≠s ganando de mano. No sab√≠a cuan temprano amanec√≠as y por eso no escrib√≠ antes. ‚ò∫
[11/7/19, 9:21:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: Un re lindo d√≠a primaveral. Me pone de muy buen humor jaja üòÅ
[11/7/19, 10:20:33 AM] Luc: Hahahah puede variar mucho, pero me gusta levantarme alrededor de las 9hs cuando no es tan dif√≠cil. As√≠ tengo 3 o 4 horas para empezar tranquilamente el d√≠a :)
[11/7/19, 10:23:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: Que bien eso!
[11/7/19, 1:11:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es posible que vaya a comprar duraznos a la salida del trabajo. Tu foto de ayer me dej√≥ muy tentada jajaja.
[11/7/19, 1:20:45 PM] Luc: Vamaaaas!
[11/7/19, 1:21:17 PM] Luc: Temporada de frutilla y durazno y ar√°ndanos... me encanta
[11/7/19, 1:22:54 PM] Luc: Ahora puedo volver a hacerme un desayuno de pudding de ch√≠a y leche de almendras y miel con frutilla y ar√°ndanos ü§§
[11/7/19, 1:25:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Suena muy rico eso!
[11/7/19, 1:25:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajaja
[11/7/19, 1:28:49 PM] Luc: Muy Berkeley
[11/7/19, 1:28:53 PM] Luc: Ala mi mam√°
[11/7/19, 1:32:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Receta familiar?
[11/7/19, 1:35:45 PM] Luc: Receta hippy m√°s que nada
[11/7/19, 1:52:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja
[11/7/19, 1:52:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Y sana
[11/7/19, 1:56:00 PM] Luc: üôÇ
[11/7/19, 1:56:23 PM] Luc: Ani, cu√°l es tu insta, te puedo seguir?

[11/7/19, 2:15:24 PM] Luc: Afuera de Villa la Angostura no?
[11/7/19, 2:15:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Laura para la familia, Ana para los amigos. Quite confusing.
[11/7/19, 2:15:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si!
[11/7/19, 2:15:40 PM] Luc: Saque una de las misma creo
‚Äé[11/7/19, 2:15:46 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/7/19, 2:16:03 PM] Luc: O maybe no
[11/7/19, 2:16:12 PM] Luc: Pero hicimos trekking tipo
[11/7/19, 2:16:33 PM] Luc: El sendero empez√≥ cerca al centro de Villa la Angostura

[11/7/19, 2:39:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Puede ser eh!
[11/7/19, 2:39:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero la agarraste con much√≠sima m√°s agua que yo üòÇ
[11/7/19, 2:44:54 PM] Luc: Hahaha es que, saque tipo 8 o 10 y las apil√© (?)
[11/7/19, 2:45:30 PM] Luc: La piedras a la izquierda son iguales. As√≠ que.. mira nosotros. Recorriendo las mismas rutitas del mundo
[11/7/19, 2:54:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ahhhh muy astuto
[11/7/19, 2:54:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja
[11/7/19, 2:55:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mir√° si est√°bamos ah√≠ el mismo d√≠a
[11/7/19, 2:56:23 PM] Luc: Estuve con mi hermana y su novio (ahora marido)
[11/7/19, 2:56:31 PM] Luc: Abril del a√±o pasado
[11/7/19, 3:50:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaj yo este febrero
[11/7/19, 4:10:18 PM] Luc: Bienn fr√≠o
[11/7/19, 4:15:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nooo. Est√°s pensando en tu invierno creo. üòÇ
[11/7/19, 4:15:33 PM] Luc: Oh hah ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[11/7/19, 4:15:43 PM] Luc: Ni me respondas

[11/7/19, 5:49:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que tal tu jueves?
[11/7/19, 7:24:01 PM] Luc: Hola!
[11/7/19, 7:24:18 PM] Luc: Perd√≥n! Ya estoy llegando a p√≥ker night con los boys
[11/7/19, 7:24:34 PM] Luc: Pero seguramente pierdo r√°pido y me voy hahahaha
[11/7/19, 7:28:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nada que perdonar! Have fun!

[11/7/19, 11:45:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Expl√≠came ese sticker
[11/7/19, 11:46:04 PM] Luc: Hola! C√≥mo estuvo??
[11/7/19, 11:46:52 PM] Luc: Soy yo escuchando tu voz hahah
[11/7/19, 11:55:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Muy buena!
[11/7/19, 11:57:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Triste, pero excelente
[11/7/19, 11:57:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: Como te fue a vos?
[11/7/19, 11:57:40 PM] Luc: La re quiero ver!
[11/7/19, 11:57:46 PM] Luc: Perd√≠ en 90 minutos
[11/7/19, 11:57:51 PM] Luc: Que verg√ºenza
[11/7/19, 11:59:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: üò™
[11/7/19, 11:59:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero pasaste un buen rato por lo menos?
[11/8/19, 12:00:39 AM] Luc: Yeah always a good time
[11/8/19, 12:01:07 AM] Luc: And Joaquin Phoenix, deserving of an Oscar?
[11/8/19, 12:02:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: Absolutely
[11/8/19, 12:05:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: He makes you feel it.
[11/8/19, 12:05:59 AM] Luc: Better than my main man Heath Ledger?
[11/8/19, 12:15:02 AM] Anita Zuddio: I haven‚Äôt seen him play the Joker. Can‚Äôt judge.
[11/8/19, 12:15:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: (I‚Äôm sorry)
[11/8/19, 12:15:16 AM] Luc: Never saw the old Batman movies?
[11/8/19, 12:15:19 AM] Luc: Add it to the list
[11/8/19, 12:15:27 AM] Luc: They're a treat
[11/8/19, 12:16:39 AM] Anita Zuddio: Just a few of the old ones. But I didn‚Äôt get to any of the dark knight ones.
[11/8/19, 12:17:06 AM] Luc: Oh Ani
[11/8/19, 12:17:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: You‚Äôll realize soon that I owe myself many good ones.
[11/8/19, 12:17:18 AM] Luc: Que deprivation
[11/8/19, 12:17:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not proud at all haha
[11/8/19, 12:17:47 AM] Luc: I think I can deal with it
[11/8/19, 12:18:01 AM] Luc: Plus there are a lot of movies that could use a good rewatching
[11/8/19, 12:18:21 AM] Luc: In this you're lucky. For every Argentine movie there are like 1000 American ones to binge on
[11/8/19, 12:18:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha true that
[11/8/19, 12:20:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: I was going to say that I will catch up. But that‚Äôs kind of impossible haha.
[11/8/19, 12:21:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: But I do wanna see some old good ones that I haven‚Äôt seen yet. Like The Godfather.
[11/8/19, 12:22:01 AM] Luc: I've never seen the godfather
[11/8/19, 12:22:09 AM] Luc: But this is like a marathon of a movie
[11/8/19, 12:24:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: What do you mean?
[11/8/19, 12:24:37 AM] Luc: I think it's 3 hours long!
[11/8/19, 12:25:02 AM] Luc: I have such a bad attention span. I'm like a puppy but far less cute
[11/8/19, 12:25:17 AM] Luc: However I am potty trained
[11/8/19, 12:25:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/8/19, 12:25:26 AM] Luc: I'm told that's a big plus
[11/8/19, 12:26:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: You just got cuter after that.
[11/8/19, 12:27:11 AM] Luc: I peaked very early
‚Äé[11/8/19, 12:27:26 AM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/8/19, 12:27:31 AM] Luc: Right here actually
[11/8/19, 12:27:36 AM] Luc: This very day
[11/8/19, 12:27:41 AM] Luc: It's been all downhill since
[11/8/19, 12:28:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/8/19, 12:28:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs the precise moment. Undoubtedly.
[11/8/19, 12:30:12 AM] Luc: Could use my ears as wings
[11/8/19, 12:30:17 AM] Luc: Are you back home now?
‚Äé[11/8/19, 12:31:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/8/19, 12:31:41 AM] Luc: What is this thing you're hugging?? Hahaha
[11/8/19, 12:32:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah. Preparing tomorrow‚Äôs lunch
[11/8/19, 12:32:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: A fake tree I guess.
[11/8/19, 12:32:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: I think that‚Äôs some theme park. Not sure which.
[11/8/19, 12:34:18 AM] Luc: Hay elefantes
[11/8/19, 12:34:34 AM] Luc: I hope it's a theme park for your own safety
[11/8/19, 12:34:51 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/8/19, 12:44:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: So how was your day? Apart from your (brief) poker night.
[11/8/19, 12:45:01 AM] Luc: Super nice
[11/8/19, 12:45:14 AM] Luc: It was hot!
[11/8/19, 12:45:59 AM] Luc: Have you ever seen a lizard here in capital? I haven't until today when I came home to find a lil guy hiding in my apartment. Guess I shouldn't leave all my stuff open
[11/8/19, 12:48:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: So I was told! By the time I got back from the office it was really nice. Luckily.
[11/8/19, 12:51:48 AM] Luc: And yours?
[11/8/19, 12:52:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Really good!
[11/8/19, 12:53:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt have classes. So my mum stopped by and we had some mates. And then I proofread some translations in bed.
[11/8/19, 12:53:44 AM] Luc: No classes on Thursday you said
[11/8/19, 12:53:46 AM] Luc: Ah yeah
[11/8/19, 12:54:01 AM] Luc: Bed, the only place to get serious work done
‚Äé[11/8/19, 12:54:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/8/19, 12:55:31 AM] Luc: Vistaza!!
[11/8/19, 12:55:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: So I suddenly became British with that ‚Äúmum‚Äù. Ignore that haha.
[11/8/19, 12:56:07 AM] Luc: I wasn't gonna mention it but I did shudder a tiny bit üòÇ
[11/8/19, 12:56:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/8/19, 12:58:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: Do you detect it easily? I mean, when someone isn‚Äôt native and mixes American with British?
[11/8/19, 12:58:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Well, I guess you do haha
[11/8/19, 12:58:40 AM] Luc: Unfortunately yes, I mean it's not a big deal AT ALL but for some reason it sticks out like a sore thumb
[11/8/19, 12:58:59 AM] Luc: And I like British people
[11/8/19, 12:59:08 AM] Luc: But as an American it's my job to pretend I hate them
[11/8/19, 12:59:20 AM] Luc: And I'm nothing if not a doer of my job
[11/8/19, 1:03:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/8/19, 1:04:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, all those missing Rs
[11/8/19, 1:04:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: What‚Äôs wrong with them?
[11/8/19, 1:04:37 AM] Luc: Someone once told me
[11/8/19, 1:04:42 AM] Luc: And I have no clue if it's true
[11/8/19, 1:04:58 AM] Luc: That an American accent is essentially a British accent from 200 years ago
[11/8/19, 1:05:08 AM] Luc: And that THEY are the ones who changed
[11/8/19, 1:05:24 AM] Luc: Again this needs to be highlighted
[11/8/19, 1:06:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: I had never heard of that. But it‚Äôs perfectly possible
[11/8/19, 1:07:33 AM] Luc: I'm pretty beat
[11/8/19, 1:07:54 AM] Luc: Gonna get ready for bed and then probably get into bed and all of a sudden have a ton of energy
[11/8/19, 1:10:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: You‚Äôll have to tell me how you do that. It doesn‚Äôt work like that with me haha
[11/8/19, 1:11:03 AM] Luc: I'd tell you to drink coffee but you already do
[11/8/19, 1:11:09 AM] Anita Zuddio: I basically die at 1.30, and I‚Äôm reborn around 6.45.
[11/8/19, 1:11:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: I have one in my hand right now
[11/8/19, 1:11:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: Literally
[11/8/19, 1:12:02 AM] Luc: As long as you don't wake me up, you can be reborn at any time you like
[11/8/19, 1:12:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha don‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs during the week.
[11/8/19, 1:12:27 AM] Luc: I am decidedly anti-rebirth before 8:30 or 9
[11/8/19, 1:12:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Anyhow. I don‚Äôt wanna stop you.
[11/8/19, 1:12:39 AM] Luc: Already brushing away here
[11/8/19, 1:13:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sleep tight!
[11/8/19, 1:13:35 AM] Luc: What are you gonna do?
[11/8/19, 1:13:41 AM] Luc: Coffee n work?
[11/8/19, 1:15:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Nooo. I spent my lunch time correcting some awful translations.
[11/8/19, 1:15:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: So that I didn‚Äôt have to do that now. I‚Äôm heading to bed.
[11/8/19, 1:15:52 AM] Luc: Ahh
[11/8/19, 1:15:55 AM] Luc: Yes ma'am
[11/8/19, 1:16:01 AM] Luc: Sleep well :)
[11/8/19, 1:18:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: You too ‚ò∫
[11/8/19, 8:13:06 AM] Anita Zuddio: Morning! Hope you have very nice day üòÅ
[11/8/19, 11:23:24 AM] Luc: Hey there, thanks! You too!
[11/8/19, 11:32:45 AM] Luc: How was your night, slept okay?
[11/8/19, 12:40:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Good! Yeah.
[11/8/19, 12:41:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: And it‚Äôs finally Friday üôåüèº
[11/8/19, 12:41:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: How about you?
[11/8/19, 12:48:55 PM] Luc: I had a dream that I was with my friends back home at their house for a party and the next day I woke up hungover and everyone was really mad at me and they had this big meeting where they all got together to scold me for getting drunk and stealing all of greg's refrigerator magnets
[11/8/19, 1:35:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahahaha
[11/8/19, 1:36:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: You reversioned the story of the mannequin.
[11/8/19, 2:06:54 PM] Luc: That's my brain for ya
[11/8/19, 4:40:10 PM] Luc: Hi
[11/8/19, 4:43:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hey! How‚Äôs your day going?
[11/8/19, 4:43:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry, meant to answer this and got stuck with work.
[11/8/19, 4:43:30 PM] Luc: No no you're totally fine
[11/8/19, 4:44:28 PM] Luc: I was expecting delivery of my couch which I ordered October 2nd. Scheduled for between 10-3 today. They call me at 3:30 to tell me it's not coming. I ask to set the next date. They tell me they don't know. So mostly I'm annoyed about that
[11/8/19, 4:44:49 PM] Luc: Hit a wall with my project so gotta step away and take a walk to clear my mind :)
[11/8/19, 4:44:53 PM] Luc: How are you?
[11/8/19, 4:49:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not cool at all!
[11/8/19, 4:50:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: But you have an amazing reading spot in the meantime.
[11/8/19, 4:51:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòä
[11/8/19, 4:51:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: That was a great idea. It‚Äôs an amazing day outside.
[11/8/19, 5:00:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Great! I‚Äôve been buying plane tickets for the last hour. My inner travel agent is having so much fun haha.
[11/8/19, 5:18:27 PM] Luc: Within Colombia I assume?
‚Äé[11/8/19, 5:22:19 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/8/19, 5:22:31 PM] Luc: The city is oversaturated
[11/8/19, 5:22:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha love it
[11/8/19, 5:23:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: I wish. For my bosses.
[11/8/19, 5:23:23 PM] Luc: Oh hahaha
[11/8/19, 5:24:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: I bought some for myself yesterday tho. Will be traveling for work by the end of November.
[11/8/19, 5:24:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: You are gonna laugh when I tell you what‚Äôs the trip about.
[11/8/19, 5:33:24 PM] Luc: Curiousity piqued
‚Äé[11/8/19, 5:33:28 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted

[11/8/19, 5:37:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nice!
[11/8/19, 5:38:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: I have a huge pile of books waiting for me to finish with my exams.
[11/8/19, 5:39:18 PM] Luc: Anything of note?

[11/8/19, 5:49:02 PM] Luc: Nope
[11/8/19, 5:49:14 PM] Luc: How'd you know?
[11/8/19, 5:50:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: I love that area. You have plenty of cafes, Kel in the corner.

[11/8/19, 5:51:28 PM] Luc: The book was the giveaway

[11/8/19, 5:58:03 PM] Luc: Oh I'm acutely aware! Two years of an hour at least each day walking (rain or shine) and I still have only seen a fraction of the city
[11/8/19, 5:58:10 PM] Luc: WHO ARE YOU
[11/8/19, 6:00:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/8/19, 6:00:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: You really need to come to the other side (of General Paz).
[11/8/19, 6:00:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Believe me
[11/8/19, 6:04:32 PM] Luc: I could be convinced to make a sincere effort
[11/8/19, 6:05:11 PM] Luc: Too many Roca rides traumatized me though, not a big lover of trains here üôä
[11/8/19, 6:07:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: No train needed
[11/8/19, 6:08:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: From where you were, yo can take the 19. Lovely ride.

[11/8/19, 6:35:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yes!
[11/8/19, 6:36:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Came straight to the supermarket from work and forgot the list at home apparently. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/8/19, 6:37:14 PM] Luc: Still write your lists by hand?
[11/8/19, 6:37:20 PM] Luc: That's old fashioned and charming
[11/8/19, 6:37:29 PM] Luc: Really! I'm not being a dick haha

[11/9/19, 1:04:13 AM] Luc: Los pol√≠ticos argentinos tienen que ser el grupo menos diverso del mundo. Hasta con respeto a estilos de pelo y tal
[11/9/19, 1:04:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajajaja
[11/9/19, 1:04:45 AM] Anita Zuddio: Vienen estandarizados

[11/10/19, 4:39:02 AM] Luc: I only beat you by about 4 minutes
[11/10/19, 4:39:39 AM] Luc: Get some rest. Thanks for the chat tonight, I enjoyed it :)
[11/10/19, 4:46:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: So did I! Thanks for waiting for the bus with me also.

[11/10/19, 11:46:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: Good morning! (:
[11/10/19, 11:47:34 AM] Anita Zuddio: I was haha. I just woke up.
[11/10/19, 11:47:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Did you sleep well?
[11/10/19, 11:54:46 AM] Luc: Not particularly üòï
[11/10/19, 11:54:57 AM] Luc: But I have coffee! So everything should be just fine.
[11/10/19, 11:55:02 AM] Luc: And yourself?
[11/10/19, 11:56:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: Oh. üò¢ No reason whatsoever?
[11/10/19, 11:57:20 AM] Anita Zuddio: I  did. But woke up with a headache. I slept more than I should have probably haha.
[11/10/19, 11:57:24 AM] Luc: Probably my anxiety that you got hit by a car kept waking me up? üòõ
[11/10/19, 11:59:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/10/19, 12:00:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: I believe it was your anxiety for getting your couch this semanita actually.
[11/10/19, 12:01:22 PM] Luc: We both know that next Friday she'll call me back and tell me it's not coming
[11/10/19, 12:01:38 PM] Luc: And then I'm moving back to the USA
[11/10/19, 12:01:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/10/19, 12:01:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not dramatic at all
[11/10/19, 12:02:16 PM] Luc: It's dramatic but it feels proportional
[11/10/19, 12:03:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: True that. You cannot live in a place where they don‚Äôt understand the importance of getting your furniture on time.
[11/10/19, 12:04:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Do you wanna hear something funny? I dreamt I was in the US.
[11/10/19, 12:04:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Probably because we spoke in English up to the end of the night. I guess.
[11/10/19, 12:04:49 PM] Luc: Do tell
[11/10/19, 12:06:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was rushing to get on one last roller coaster before having to head to the airport.
[11/10/19, 12:08:21 PM] Luc: Your dresms sound nice
[11/10/19, 12:08:32 PM] Luc: You must have a clean conscience
[11/10/19, 12:08:36 PM] Luc: Wanna trade dreams?
[11/10/19, 12:08:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: It wasn‚Äôt. I never got to ride! üò≠
[11/10/19, 12:08:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/10/19, 12:09:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not so sure. I‚Äôm scared about yours after you said that.
[11/10/19, 12:09:42 PM] Luc: I steal refrigerator magnets
[11/10/19, 12:09:49 PM] Luc: Apparently.
[11/10/19, 12:09:57 PM] Luc: As far as I know I've never done it in real life
[11/10/19, 12:10:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Right! I‚Äôm not sure if I will ever invite you over. I mean. Magnets are sacred.
[11/10/19, 12:12:12 PM] Luc: I've already got the best ones okay
[11/10/19, 12:12:28 PM] Luc: Plus I'm feeling like yours will be very girly?
[11/10/19, 12:13:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, they are. But then I have a F1 car in the middle, to compensate I guess haha.
[11/10/19, 12:13:39 PM] Luc: Oh right i totally failed to ask you about that
[11/10/19, 12:14:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: I absolutely forgot you wanted to ask. I‚Äôm sorry.
[11/10/19, 12:15:30 PM] Luc: This is a very unnecessary apology Anita
[11/10/19, 12:17:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: It probably is.
[11/10/19, 12:17:39 PM] Luc: Did your guy or gal win?
[11/10/19, 12:18:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: No race this weekend üò™
[11/10/19, 12:19:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: But we already know who is this year‚Äôs champion. Not that fond of him (amazing driver tho).
[11/10/19, 12:19:58 PM] Luc: So like
[11/10/19, 12:20:03 PM] Luc: They're racing around all crazy
[11/10/19, 12:20:09 PM] Luc: And depending on how they finish
[11/10/19, 12:20:13 PM] Luc: They gain points
[11/10/19, 12:20:22 PM] Luc: And at the end of the season most points win?
[11/10/19, 12:22:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly. There was such a big difference between the first and the second driver, that we have two races left but we already know that nobody will catch up with him.
[11/10/19, 12:23:09 PM] Luc: Do they have personalities?
[11/10/19, 12:23:14 PM] Luc: Like they get out of their cars and
[11/10/19, 12:23:20 PM] Luc: They talk shit about eachother?
[11/10/19, 12:23:26 PM] Luc: In very funny accents?
[11/10/19, 12:23:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha not as much as you would like, I guess. But they do.
[11/10/19, 12:24:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Specially when the two best drivers of the season belong to the same team and have strong personalities.
[11/10/19, 12:28:22 PM] Luc: Which nationality?
[11/10/19, 12:28:28 PM] Luc: Who's your guy or gal?
[11/10/19, 12:32:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: The last time this happened? British and German.
[11/10/19, 12:33:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: My guy stop racing last year actually. Fernando Alonso (Spaniard).
[11/10/19, 12:34:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Now I would say Daniel Ricciardo (Aussie) but he isn‚Äôt in a leading team, so he wasn‚Äôt even close to winning the championship. I really like the way he drives tho.
[11/10/19, 12:35:08 PM] Luc: This is fascinating to me
[11/10/19, 12:35:16 PM] Luc: Not the sport but the way you talk about it
[11/10/19, 12:36:53 PM] Luc: Like when someone shows you a photograph and you say "nice photo!" but then they go unpacking all of the little details and context and it becomes something a lot more interesting
[11/10/19, 12:37:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha stop me if I get carried away anyway
[11/10/19, 12:37:43 PM] Luc: I dunno if I could watch F1 but I could watch you watch it, if that makes sense? Haha :)
[11/10/19, 12:39:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha you would watch me eat or have way too much coffee for around an hour and a half.
[11/10/19, 12:39:27 PM] Luc: I literally
[11/10/19, 12:39:31 PM] Luc: On Saturdays
[11/10/19, 12:39:44 PM] Luc: Cannot drink caffeine if I'm going to watch my team play
[11/10/19, 12:39:50 PM] Luc: Because my heart will explode
[11/10/19, 12:40:10 PM] Luc: Sports anxiety is no joke Anita
[11/10/19, 12:41:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: I know!
[11/10/19, 12:42:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: How many stories of people getting a stroke in a stadium have we heard? People can be really passionate.
[11/10/19, 12:42:51 PM] Luc: Don't ask me how many times I've seen the YouTube video of the old Argentine man screaming at his TV
[11/10/19, 12:43:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/10/19, 12:43:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: He is a really good example
[11/10/19, 12:46:34 PM] Luc: Tano Pasman
[11/10/19, 12:46:38 PM] Luc: Ah√≠ est√°
[11/10/19, 12:46:50 PM] Luc: What a joy to watch
[11/10/19, 12:48:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Didn‚Äôt know you were trying to remember his name. I would have spared you the search.
[11/10/19, 12:50:21 PM] Luc: What a legend
[11/10/19, 12:58:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: He is part of our history now üòÇ
[11/10/19, 12:59:47 PM] Luc: I need to make a sticker that's like
[11/10/19, 12:59:53 PM] Luc: A pantheon of Argentine legends
[11/10/19, 1:00:00 PM] Luc: Tano

[11/10/19, 1:00:35 PM] Luc: In a collage
[11/10/19, 1:01:01 PM] Luc: Just to demonstrate how ludicrous and beautiful Argentine meme culture is
‚Äé[11/10/19, 1:01:26 PM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/10/19, 1:01:36 PM] Luc: Can't forget El.pibe molotovero
[11/10/19, 1:02:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: So sad but such a good sticker at the same time!
[11/10/19, 1:02:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hey. I remembered this morning that in between bars you were up to an ice cream. I owe you that.
[11/10/19, 1:09:40 PM] Luc: Don't hate me but I actually almost never eat ice cream. Or really sweets in general üò∂
[11/10/19, 1:09:50 PM] Luc: Mostly I was looking for an excuse to keep spending time with you
[11/10/19, 1:10:03 PM] Luc: But of course I'll take you up on the offer some time
[11/10/19, 1:14:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Chocolate either? We need to have a serious talk here, Luc.
[11/10/19, 1:14:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[11/10/19, 1:15:59 PM] Luc: Chocolate either üôä
[11/10/19, 1:16:07 PM] Luc: I don't dislike sweets
[11/10/19, 1:16:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well, this was my excuse to ask you out soon. So I guess we are on the same page.
[11/10/19, 1:16:33 PM] Luc: I just never grew up eating them, or dessert, or meriendas
[11/10/19, 1:16:45 PM] Luc: So like
[11/10/19, 1:16:47 PM] Luc: I suck
[11/10/19, 1:16:48 PM] Luc: Haha
[11/10/19, 1:17:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: I can renew the offer with some other thing you like, no problem at all.
[11/10/19, 1:17:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha you don‚Äôt
[11/10/19, 1:22:00 PM] Luc: Word, maybe a mate in the park and a nice walk? Or any of the places you haven't been yet that are cool? CCR, CCK (shudder), San Telmo?
[11/10/19, 1:23:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Absolutely
[11/10/19, 1:24:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Or mates by the river. And I get to show you a bit of Vicente Lopez.
[11/10/19, 1:24:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Does your knee still hurt?
[11/10/19, 1:24:57 PM] Luc: Yeah I'm roto girl
[11/10/19, 1:25:18 PM] Luc: Nah it'll be fine tomorrow. But I'm gonna injure Nure next weekend as payback
[11/10/19, 1:35:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: Poor thing üò™. Put some ice on it.
[11/10/19, 1:35:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm not so sure if that‚Äôs how it works haha.
[11/10/19, 1:37:18 PM] Luc: Oh Anita, so innocent
[11/10/19, 1:37:29 PM] Luc: Down here in Capital the rule is kill or be killed
‚Äé[11/10/19, 1:38:05 PM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/10/19, 1:46:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: Now I will have nightmares
[11/10/19, 1:46:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Thank you very much
[11/10/19, 1:46:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/10/19, 1:47:55 PM] Luc: Since you're a provincia girl I'd need to send you a kicillof sticker
[11/10/19, 1:47:59 PM] Luc: Equally nightmare inducing
[11/10/19, 1:55:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Please don‚Äôt
[11/10/19, 1:58:19 PM] Luc: Consider yourself spared üòò
[11/10/19, 2:03:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Thanks üòÖ
[11/10/19, 2:04:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs an AMAZING day for your Sunday walk.
[11/10/19, 2:04:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: I love this time of the year.
[11/10/19, 2:06:10 PM] Luc: I know it! And my day was so fortunately liberated by the cancellation of the friend of friend and so I'm already planning my route
[11/10/19, 2:16:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs great!
[11/10/19, 2:17:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: At what time do you usually go?
[11/10/19, 2:17:41 PM] Luc: Usually between my first and second bout of fiaca?
[11/10/19, 2:17:53 PM] Luc: So around 3pm I'd say. I'm a slow starter
[11/10/19, 2:23:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/10/19, 2:23:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Got it
[11/10/19, 3:44:44 PM] Luc: And you, did you get all restless and go out? Invite a friend over?
[11/10/19, 3:45:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Maybe üôÑ
[11/10/19, 3:46:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm heading to my sister‚Äôs (she has a nice garden, I didn‚Äôt wanna waste the day inside). And then a friend is coming over for dinner.
[11/10/19, 3:46:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: I can‚Äôt help it hahaha
[11/10/19, 3:46:35 PM] Luc: Hahaha
[11/10/19, 3:46:40 PM] Luc: You're exceptional
[11/10/19, 3:46:46 PM] Luc: Good on you
[11/10/19, 3:47:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I also got to do some things at home. Like ordering my spices.
[11/10/19, 3:47:35 PM] Luc: You order? Do tell
[11/10/19, 3:47:41 PM] Luc: I didn't know that was a thing
[11/10/19, 3:48:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: No. Wait. I meant arranging. Putting in order.
[11/10/19, 3:48:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: That came out wrong
[11/10/19, 3:48:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Haha
[11/10/19, 3:49:17 PM] Luc: Ahh
[11/10/19, 3:49:39 PM] Luc: I like that you say you got to do it
[11/10/19, 3:49:50 PM] Luc: The privilege was bestowed upon you :)
[11/10/19, 3:51:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/10/19, 3:52:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Didn‚Äôt sound very natural, did it?
[11/10/19, 3:55:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: This will probably sound silly. But I was just thinking that I had a really good time last night. Thanks for that! ‚ò∫ GREAT bar choices btw.
[11/10/19, 3:57:02 PM] Luc: It sounded natural coming from you because I think I know you well enough to believe you took some amount of pleasure organizing them, no?
[11/10/19, 3:58:27 PM] Luc: Not silly, glad you said it. I enjoyed it quite a lot as well and more than that I'm happy you did
[11/10/19, 3:59:07 PM] Luc: I'm a lil weird and you didn't seem to mind _that_ much
[11/10/19, 4:00:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah. A bit.
[11/10/19, 4:01:08 PM] Luc: A bit she says
[11/10/19, 4:01:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha that‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm also a lil weird.
[11/10/19, 4:04:55 PM] Luc: I didn't think so, but whatever you are it was endearing
[11/10/19, 5:06:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: üôà
[11/10/19, 5:10:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Apologies for the delay. Got to my sister‚Äôs place and my niece caught all my attention haha.
[11/10/19, 5:10:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: How was your walk? Or is?
[11/10/19, 5:12:54 PM] Luc: Got a little sidetracked! Leaving in about 20 minutes, was cooking and cleaning :)
[11/10/19, 5:16:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Great

[11/10/19, 5:33:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, I love her
[11/10/19, 9:27:46 PM] Luc: Had a nice day?

[11/10/19, 11:57:36 PM] Luc: This chapter is a bit sentimental üòâ
[11/10/19, 11:59:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Great! One of my friends is living in San Luis and we hadn‚Äôt seen each other for a while. So we caught up.
[11/11/19, 12:02:01 AM] Luc: Sounds nice, I'm glad!
[11/11/19, 12:02:23 AM] Luc: Much to do tonight, or just sleep?
[11/11/19, 12:03:20 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ohhh. You are missing the handkerchieves.
[11/11/19, 12:03:50 AM] Luc: Uff

[11/11/19, 12:48:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Es un matiz que no se si sabes, pero ac√° a veces usamos ‚Äúsimp√°tico‚Äù, como forma sutil de decir que alguien no es lindo cuando nos preguntan. Espero que no sea el caso. üòÖ
[11/11/19, 12:50:29 AM] Luc: Oh no! Al reves, de hecho
[11/11/19, 12:50:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pero no dormiste tan bien anoche, quiz√°s el cansancio ayuda y te duermes r√°pido igual.

[11/11/19, 12:51:14 AM] Luc: Est√°s por acostarte?

[11/11/19, 7:37:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Mil perdones! Pens√© que iba a durar un rato m√°s despierta y no sucedi√≥.
[11/11/19, 7:38:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: No tuvo nada que ver con la trivia de historia alemana üòÇ
[11/11/19, 7:38:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: Que tengas lindo dia! ‚ò∫
[11/11/19, 9:45:36 AM] Luc: Hahahaha
[11/11/19, 9:45:40 AM] Luc: Buen d√≠a!
[11/11/19, 10:00:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pudiste descansar esta vez?
[11/11/19, 11:39:17 AM] Luc: Yes! üôåüèº
[11/11/19, 11:39:24 AM] Luc: Y vos?
[11/11/19, 11:50:57 AM] Anita Zuddio: Me alegro!
[11/11/19, 11:50:58 AM] Anita Zuddio: Siii
[11/11/19, 11:51:21 AM] Anita Zuddio: Y hoy no me voy a estar acostando tan tarde creo, gran manera de empezar la semana üòÅ
[11/11/19, 11:51:45 AM] Luc: üôåüèº
[11/11/19, 11:54:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: Un lunes tranquilo?
[11/11/19, 12:13:43 PM] Luc: Para mi? Un par de reuniones, nada demasiado estresante :)
[11/11/19, 12:39:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Excelente!
[11/11/19, 5:41:12 PM] Luc: Hola Anita
[11/11/19, 5:41:53 PM] Luc: No s√© si est√°s yendo por alg√∫n lado ya que son las 17:40 pero iba preguntarte c√≥mo te va el d√≠a
[11/11/19, 5:44:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ey! Camino a la facultad justamente.
[11/11/19, 5:44:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Muy tranquilo mi lunes por suerte. El tuyo?
[11/11/19, 5:44:59 PM] Luc: Normal :)
[11/11/19, 5:45:09 PM] Luc: Me jefa se comprometi√≥
[11/11/19, 5:45:18 PM] Luc: Es la √∫nica novedad hahaha
[11/11/19, 5:47:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: Eso quiere decir que ten√©s una boda a la que asistir pronto?
[11/11/19, 5:47:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si es as√≠, es una gran novedad jajaja
[11/11/19, 5:56:09 PM] Luc: No tan pronto, espero. Ya est√°s presentando una solicitud formal a ser mi +1? üòõ
[11/11/19, 5:56:47 PM] Luc: Normalmente en los EEUU se espera 12 a 18 meses despu√©s del compromiso
[11/11/19, 5:58:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja no lo dije por eso, pero puedo hacer el esfuerzo y vestirme linda, ning√∫n problema.
[11/11/19, 5:58:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: No sab√≠a eso!
[11/11/19, 5:59:06 PM] Luc: Hahah me alegro, pero si bien me invitan, es un 99% que digo que no
[11/11/19, 5:59:24 PM] Luc: No vale toda la pena volver a los EEUU para un casamiento si no es un amigo muy cercano
[11/11/19, 5:59:33 PM] Luc: Ac√° no es as√≠?
[11/11/19, 6:00:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Buen punto
[11/11/19, 6:01:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: No es tan preciso. Algunos ni siquiera se comprometen y se casan directamente. Otros pueden estar ese tiempo o m√°s comprometidos hasta casarse.
[11/11/19, 6:01:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Depende mucho de cada caso
[11/11/19, 6:04:25 PM] Luc: Fui a un casamiento ac√° pero hace 2 a√±os
[11/11/19, 6:04:35 PM] Luc: En el club de regatas de tigre, creo?
[11/11/19, 6:04:41 PM] Luc: Suuuuper lujoso
[11/11/19, 6:05:15 PM] Luc: Era lindo pero a la vez un poquito.. stuffy
[11/11/19, 6:11:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es re lindo ese edificio!
[11/11/19, 6:11:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nunca estuve adentro igual
[11/11/19, 6:11:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja stuffy
[11/11/19, 6:11:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Demasiado cerrado? O demasiada gente para el tama√±o del sal√≥n?
[11/11/19, 6:15:25 PM] Luc: La gente cerrada m√°s que nada
[11/11/19, 6:15:35 PM] Luc: Ac√° existe
[11/11/19, 6:15:49 PM] Luc: Uni√≥n c√≠vica? No s√© c√≥mo se llama
[11/11/19, 6:16:28 PM] Luc: O sea, un estado relaci√≥n en lo cual ten√©s todos los derechos de una pareja casada?
[11/11/19, 6:16:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Uni√≥n convivencias
[11/11/19, 6:16:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: *convivencial
[11/11/19, 6:16:58 PM] Luc: Est√°
[11/11/19, 6:17:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Se cre√≥ hace poco igual. Con la sanci√≥n del nuevo c√≥digo civil.
[11/11/19, 6:17:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Dato totalmente in√∫til jaja)
[11/11/19, 6:17:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Por?
[11/11/19, 6:18:10 PM] Luc: No entiendo üò∂
[11/11/19, 6:19:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Antes no exist√≠a para la ley
[11/11/19, 6:19:14 PM] Luc: Ahhh
[11/11/19, 6:19:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: En el 2015 se modific√≥ nuestro c√≥digo civil y se agreg√≥
[11/11/19, 6:19:18 PM] Luc: Perd√≥n lo le√≠ mal haha
[11/11/19, 6:19:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: No fui muy clara yo tampoco, tranqui jaja
[11/11/19, 6:25:27 PM] Luc: Esta piba sabe un poco de todo
[11/11/19, 6:43:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja
[11/11/19, 6:43:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Lo suficiente para sostener una conversaci√≥n por lo menos jaja
[11/11/19, 6:43:55 PM] Luc: Ahora te lo hago f√°cil
[11/11/19, 6:44:00 PM] Luc: Que opinas?
[11/11/19, 6:44:34 PM] Luc: Del tema, compromiso, casamiento, union convivencial, etc.
[11/11/19, 6:46:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja me es m√°s f√°cil hablarte de la ley creo üòÇ
[11/11/19, 6:47:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me parece una gran (y muy linda) demostraci√≥n de compromiso hacia la otra persona.
[11/11/19, 6:48:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: La uni√≥n convivencial es un gris (un punto medio) raro. Deber√≠a leer m√°s por qu√© la gente opta por eso y no por el matrimonio. O sea, las diferencias formales/legales.
[11/11/19, 6:51:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Porque no lo tengo claro.
[11/11/19, 6:52:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero a√∫n as√≠, me parece muy lindo que la gente decida hacerlo. Sea cual sea. Y cada vez pasa menos.
[11/11/19, 6:52:35 PM] Luc: Cada vez pasa menos?
[11/11/19, 6:54:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si. Ac√° por lo menos, cada vez menos gente se casa.
[11/11/19, 6:54:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Conviven y forman una familia. Pero sin casarse.
[11/11/19, 6:54:42 PM] Luc: Una tendencia mundial, creo
[11/11/19, 6:55:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es posible
[11/11/19, 6:55:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me parece un poco triste.
[11/11/19, 6:55:29 PM] Luc: O por lo menos los pa√≠ses m√°s desarrollados
[11/11/19, 6:55:45 PM] Luc: Ahora se opina!
[11/11/19, 6:55:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero corto ac√° con la Ani cheesy jajaja
[11/11/19, 6:55:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Estoy esperando tu opini√≥n igual
[11/11/19, 6:56:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Esto ya hab√≠a sido una re opini√≥n jaja
[11/11/19, 6:58:24 PM] Luc: Casarse, dec√≠s?
[11/11/19, 6:59:47 PM] Luc: No tengo opini√≥n fuerte con respeto al tema
[11/11/19, 7:00:35 PM] Luc: Me voy a casar alg√∫n d√≠a, espero. Me gusta la idea
[11/11/19, 7:02:26 PM] Luc: Pero entiendo que hay mucha historia y tradici√≥n de desigualdad de g√©nero que viene empaquetado con lo que es casamiento tradicional. As√≠ si la gente no lo ve como la opci√≥n m√°s justo o culturalmente sensible, me alegro que tenga otras opciones
[11/11/19, 7:04:49 PM] Luc: Talvez exista un middle ground en lo cual uno puede casarse con lo que es el compromiso y amor pero sin lo que es el papel tradicional o hasta la ceremonia tradicional. Los estados de _uni√≥n X_ son un primer paso hacia esa realidad, supongo
[11/11/19, 7:20:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me parece una buena explicaci√≥n de por qu√© alguien elegir√≠a esa opci√≥n. No lo hab√≠a pensado.
[11/11/19, 7:23:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Quiz√°s porque nunca me plante√© la desigualdad en el casamiento tradicional. Con o sin casamiento, hubo desigualdad. Y la va a seguir habiendo salvo que nos propongamos lo contrario. Independientemente del t√≠tulo que se le ponga.
[11/11/19, 7:23:50 PM] Luc: Hay dimensiones culturales tambi√©n
[11/11/19, 7:24:29 PM] Luc: O sea, pregunt√°ndole a mi papa lo que es un casamiento sale una respuesta muy diferente de lo de mi mam√° (y probablemente por eso no dur√≥ su matrimonio)
[11/11/19, 7:24:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sin dudas
[11/11/19, 7:25:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Estoy opinando desde un punto de vista m√°s objetivo creo, porque no me atraviesa una religi√≥n muy marcada.
[11/11/19, 7:26:06 PM] Luc: A m√≠ me importa m√°s que cada uno tiene una manera de comprometerse a otro/a y celebrar ese compromiso sin que tenga l√≠mites o reglas fijas adem√°s de ser fiel y que es sin fin
[11/11/19, 7:28:11 PM] Luc: Pienso en mi hermanastra, tiene 20 y recien sali√≥ a su mam√° y a mi papa y a sus abuelos (ya me hab√≠a contado hace un rato)
[11/11/19, 7:29:53 PM] Luc: Y nada, fuimos todos al casamiento de mi hermana que era lindo y muy tradicional y sent√≠ que ella (Krishna) estaba incomoda porque no pudo vestirse como quer√≠a y que no figuraba como bridesmaid ni flowergirl ni nada
[11/11/19, 7:32:59 PM] Luc: Me cuesta un poquito explicarme. M√°s que nada quiero que ella (y cualquiera que no identifica con la idea de matrimonio tradicional) tenga una opci√≥n que sea legalmente protectora y robusta
[11/11/19, 7:36:21 PM] Luc: La ley que existe ac√° (y es parecida a la que tenemos en los EEUU) me parece perfecta. Y espero que como sociedad podamos verla como una opci√≥n igualmente importante, firme, y vinculante
[11/11/19, 7:52:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me gusta como pensas
[11/11/19, 7:52:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Perdon, entre a clase
[11/11/19, 8:34:32 PM] Luc: Nada que perdonar
[11/11/19, 8:34:39 PM] Luc: Suerte! Hablamos pronto.
[11/11/19, 9:24:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ya estoy.
[11/11/19, 9:24:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Qu√© tal tu tarde/noche?
[11/11/19, 9:26:00 PM] Luc: Nice!
[11/11/19, 9:26:11 PM] Luc: Todo bien :)
[11/11/19, 9:26:26 PM] Luc: De verdad un dia bien productivo
[11/11/19, 9:28:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si? que bien! Que hiciste?
[11/11/19, 9:28:52 PM] Luc: trabajo y proyectos y compras
[11/11/19, 9:29:22 PM] Luc: sigo ac√° mandando unos mails
[11/11/19, 9:29:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Te dejo hacer tranquilo!
[11/11/19, 9:30:38 PM] Luc: no me molestas nunca
[11/11/19, 9:30:41 PM] Luc: vos, volviendo a casa?
[11/11/19, 9:32:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Siii. Tan contenta! üòÅ
[11/11/19, 9:32:56 PM] Luc: hahaha a vos te parece temprano, a mi me parece tarde igual
[11/11/19, 9:36:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja es temprano y se acabaron mis lunes de universidad, oficialmente. Porque el pr√≥ximo es feriado.
[11/11/19, 9:38:38 PM] Luc: epa!
[11/11/19, 9:40:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: No puedo pedir m√°s jaja
[11/11/19, 9:41:11 PM] Luc: y lo que queda de la semana?
[11/11/19, 9:41:18 PM] Luc: hasta las 11 cada dia menos el viernes?
[11/11/19, 9:41:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hasta las 10
[11/11/19, 9:42:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Y este mi√©rcoles no tengo que ir. Tengo cosas para hacer desde casa nada m√°s.
[11/11/19, 9:43:40 PM] Luc: aja
[11/11/19, 9:43:53 PM] Luc: as√≠ hay chance que nos veamos?
[11/11/19, 9:44:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si ten√©s ganas, por supuesto.
[11/11/19, 9:45:32 PM] Luc: Tengo ganas, pero no quiero que te estrese m√°s
[11/11/19, 9:46:10 PM] Luc: O sea, quiero ser lo mas respetuoso posible de tu horario, s√© que ten√©s unas semanas locas esta y la proxima
[11/11/19, 9:46:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sos lo m√°s
[11/11/19, 9:46:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja
[11/11/19, 9:46:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Gracias!
[11/11/19, 9:47:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si mi√©rcoles podes. Hago lo que tengo que entregar hoy, as√≠ me libero esa tarde/noche.
[11/11/19, 9:48:02 PM] Luc: Encima no te tengo que secuestrar por toda la tarde o noche, a tomar un mate y charlar por una o dos hora cuando puedas me viene muy bien
[11/11/19, 9:53:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja no es secuestra cuando es por voluntad propia. Creo.
[11/11/19, 9:53:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Genial! Si, eso si, en la semana no resisto despierta hasta muy tarde. Ya lo habr√°s notado. üòÇ
[11/11/19, 9:53:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: *secuestro
[11/11/19, 9:59:30 PM] Luc: üòá
[11/11/19, 10:00:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Aparte mi√©rcoles es impar
[11/11/19, 10:00:10 PM] Luc: Y estar√°s el miercoles por la tarde en microcentro?
[11/11/19, 10:00:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me parece adecuado
[11/11/19, 10:00:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajaja
[11/11/19, 10:00:23 PM] Luc: ya s√© ya s√© D:
[11/11/19, 10:01:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not really. Voy a estar por Vicente L√≥pez. Pero salgo del trabajo, paso por casa a sacarme el uniforme jaja, y voy a donde tengas ganas.
[11/11/19, 10:03:10 PM] Luc: Uf silly me
[11/11/19, 10:03:42 PM] Luc: Creo que tengo unas ideas
[11/11/19, 10:03:56 PM] Luc: ma√±ana te las cuento y elig√≠s vos, te parece?
[11/11/19, 10:04:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Por que ma√±ana?!
[11/11/19, 10:04:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: No me dejes con la intriga
[11/11/19, 10:04:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja
[11/11/19, 10:04:23 PM] Luc: 1. te dejo con la intriga
[11/11/19, 10:05:03 PM] Luc: 2. siempre duermo antes de tomar una decision tan importante
[11/11/19, 10:05:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Bueno, est√° bien. Espero a ma√±ana.
[11/11/19, 10:06:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Tengo que aprender a ser menos ansiosa jaja.
[11/11/19, 10:07:39 PM] Luc: tilo? quizas
[11/11/19, 10:07:45 PM] Luc: üòò
[11/11/19, 10:11:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que maldad!!
[11/11/19, 10:11:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja
[11/11/19, 10:13:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Bueno, cualquiera sea el plan, quedamos el mi√©rcoles entonces?
[11/11/19, 10:27:11 PM] Luc: s√≠, el mi√©rcoles!
[11/11/19, 10:36:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hecho! (:
[11/11/19, 10:43:17 PM] Luc: "* Version 3.12.1 (ruby 2.6.3-p62), codename: Llamas in Pajamas"
[11/11/19, 10:43:20 PM] Luc: Dale ya fue
[11/11/19, 10:43:32 PM] Luc: Llamas in Pajamas really?
[11/11/19, 10:43:51 PM] Luc: no trabajo mas esta noche, ya fue ya fue
[11/11/19, 10:52:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Vas a tener que explicarme de donde sale esto. Estoy muy perdida jaja.
[11/11/19, 10:53:02 PM] Luc: Estoy alterado hahaha

[11/11/19, 10:55:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ahhh got it
[11/11/19, 10:56:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si, me quiero re√≠r del codename, pero no porque estuviste todo ese tiempo solucionando errores. üò™
[11/12/19, 12:00:14 AM] Luc: Hi! I promise I wasn't waiting until midnight! Just cleaning the dishes :)
[11/12/19, 12:30:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I have my doubts about that.
[11/12/19, 12:31:31 AM] Luc: Well it's too late to turn back now :)
[11/12/19, 12:32:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôll get my revenge on Wednesday.
[11/12/19, 12:32:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: üòÅ
[11/12/19, 12:32:36 AM] Luc: la venganza eh
[11/12/19, 12:32:44 AM] Luc: fuertes declaraciones
[11/12/19, 12:33:06 AM] Luc: You're so anxious that I haven't told you what I have in mind
[11/12/19, 12:34:03 AM] Luc: I don't want to play with your anxiety but I am a fan of surprises
[11/12/19, 12:34:07 AM] Luc: So you put me in a tough place
[11/12/19, 12:34:52 AM] Anita Zuddio: A lil‚Äô bit...
[11/12/19, 12:35:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: But I will take it. Just because I also like surprises.
[11/12/19, 12:39:14 AM] Luc: How was your night?
[11/12/19, 12:41:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: It was ok. I did what I had to do on Wednesday while I had dinner.
[11/12/19, 12:41:55 AM] Luc: All for me?
[11/12/19, 12:41:59 AM] Luc: You didn't have to
[11/12/19, 12:42:11 AM] Luc: I'm a great translator I swear
[11/12/19, 12:42:15 AM] Luc: Bring your homework next time
[11/12/19, 12:42:43 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/12/19, 12:44:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt think translating about torts is included in the list of cool things to do on a date.
[11/12/19, 12:44:34 AM] Luc: tort law? that's sort of my thing
[11/12/19, 12:44:46 AM] Luc: well, bird law first, tort law second
[11/12/19, 12:44:56 AM] Anita Zuddio: Bird law?
[11/12/19, 12:45:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: Please explain
[11/12/19, 12:45:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[11/12/19, 12:45:47 AM] Luc: Just a joke my friends and i used to make from a show we used to watch in high school
[11/12/19, 12:46:04 AM] Luc: My brain is a little fried tonight I'm sorry :)
[11/12/19, 12:46:30 AM] Luc: It's nice to think though that there must be some lawyers out there who specialize in protecting birds
[11/12/19, 12:48:02 AM] Anita Zuddio: No need to apologize!
[11/12/19, 12:48:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs true
[11/12/19, 12:49:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: And you are definitely going to tell me more about this next time we meet.
[11/12/19, 12:50:30 AM] Luc: Happily
[11/12/19, 12:50:36 AM] Luc: Open book policy
[11/12/19, 12:50:39 AM] Luc: In full effect
[11/12/19, 12:51:05 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha great
[11/12/19, 12:53:09 AM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt wanna disappear all of a sudden again, but I don‚Äôt know how much longer will I be able to stay awake.
[11/12/19, 12:53:22 AM] Luc: Don't worry about it at all
[11/12/19, 12:53:30 AM] Luc: Get some rest, you deserve it as always
[11/12/19, 12:54:04 AM] Luc: I'm pretty beat myself, I'm gonna read my melancholy book until I fall asleep
[11/12/19, 12:54:15 AM] Luc: Though I have a strict no-reading-in-bed policy
[11/12/19, 12:54:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: Why is that?
[11/12/19, 12:55:53 AM] Luc: I notice that if I only sleep in my bed, my body knows what to do once I get into bed
[11/12/19, 12:56:13 AM] Luc: Whereas if I read or I'm on my phone or computer, then it seems to lose that association and I often lay down and can't get to sleep as easily
[11/12/19, 12:56:32 AM] Luc: So I tried this and it seems to help a lot
[11/12/19, 12:57:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: I really didn‚Äôt expect that answer at all.
[11/12/19, 12:58:09 AM] Luc: What did you expect?
[11/12/19, 1:00:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt know, that you might get caught by the story and read til very late. Or sth like that.
[11/12/19, 1:00:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: But this makes so much sense.
[11/12/19, 1:00:46 AM] Luc: It's also the genesis of the reading corner
[11/12/19, 1:01:01 AM] Luc: Trying to make my apartment fit me rather than me fitting in it
[11/12/19, 1:01:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I like that idea
[11/12/19, 1:01:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Anyways. I‚Äôll let you read your melancholy book in peace.
[11/12/19, 1:01:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sleep well (:
[11/12/19, 1:02:09 AM] Luc: You too! Talk to you tomorrow üòò
[11/12/19, 9:57:57 AM] Luc: Morning (:
[11/12/19, 11:51:02 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hey there!
[11/12/19, 11:51:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: How‚Äôs your day going?
[11/12/19, 12:43:32 PM] Luc: So far so good :)
[11/12/19, 12:43:36 PM] Luc: How about yours?
[11/12/19, 12:45:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: So far so good
[11/12/19, 12:46:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Had a talk about cyber security. Internet for dummies, basically haha.
[11/12/19, 12:47:00 PM] Luc: At work?
[11/12/19, 12:47:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap
[11/12/19, 12:48:22 PM] Luc: Let me guess.. strong passwords, don't reuse passwords, two-factor authentication, encrypted communications, don't fall for phishing attacks? 

I have to do these basically every time I work with a new client
[11/12/19, 12:48:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Some people here are afraid of OPENING emails. Not opening the content or a link in it. The email. It‚Äôs kind of cute.
[11/12/19, 12:48:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: YES!
[11/12/19, 12:49:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Don‚Äôt use a pen drive you find lost (really).
[11/12/19, 12:49:34 PM] Luc: Hahahah oh yes
[11/12/19, 12:49:44 PM] Luc: And did they talk about social engineering?
[11/12/19, 12:49:49 PM] Luc: That's always my favorite topic
[11/12/19, 12:49:59 PM] Luc: Cause someone will have an "oh shit" moment
[11/12/19, 12:50:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm not sure I know what we are talking about
[11/12/19, 12:51:26 PM] Luc: Usually it takes the form of someone calling you and pretending to be someone they're not
[11/12/19, 12:56:23 PM] Luc: It's the most sinister for sure. And also mildly fascinating because as much as you can advance technology to be more secure, the humans using it will _always_ be the weak link
[11/12/19, 12:57:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Like those asking for ransom?
[11/12/19, 12:57:57 PM] Luc: No! That's an outright crime crime. I'm talking just manipulation
[11/12/19, 12:58:01 PM] Luc: For example
[11/12/19, 12:59:00 PM] Luc: You have.. Movistar? Let's say.
[11/12/19, 12:59:44 PM] Luc: I call Movistar and I tell them I'm Anita and I lost my phone and I'd like to have my old number transferred to my new phone I just bought
[11/12/19, 1:00:25 PM] Luc: And they ask me for some very trivial information. They don't have much to identify you by anyway, maybe a birthdate, your DNI, the old number, another number on the account
[11/12/19, 1:01:17 PM] Luc: And I give them that information and they swap the numbers and all of a sudden your phone stops working and I have access to any of your accounts which have 2FA set up.
[11/12/19, 1:01:20 PM] Luc: Scary no?
[11/12/19, 1:02:01 PM] Luc: So it's like.. your phone company (which is awful at security) just became one of the most vulnerable links in the chain
[11/12/19, 1:02:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Very!
[11/12/19, 1:02:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt know that one
[11/12/19, 1:05:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt mention it today. Too many people not willing to open to.. technology? Shall we say.
[11/12/19, 1:05:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: They panic about everything
‚Äé[11/12/19, 1:06:15 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/12/19, 1:06:43 PM] Luc: Hahaha well you're officially they most capacitated as of now
[11/12/19, 1:08:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòé
[11/12/19, 1:10:06 PM] Luc: He even says "aloha"
[11/12/19, 1:10:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: One detail. What‚Äôs 2FA??!
[11/12/19, 1:11:00 PM] Luc: Two factor authentication
[11/12/19, 1:11:08 PM] Luc: Like using your phone number to receive a code
[11/12/19, 1:11:13 PM] Luc: Sorry!!
[11/12/19, 1:11:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: it‚Äôs very cute haha
[11/12/19, 1:29:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm I‚Äôll have to google that
[11/12/19, 1:29:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt wanna keep asking haha
[11/12/19, 1:29:17 PM] Luc: Google what!
[11/12/19, 1:29:25 PM] Luc: You already have it set up
[11/12/19, 1:29:40 PM] Luc: Go try to change your Apple ID password and you'll know what I'm talking about üòò
[11/12/19, 1:30:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha got it
[11/12/19, 1:38:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Did you sleep over tomorrow‚Äôs plans?
[11/12/19, 1:38:40 PM] Luc: Hahahah there it is!
[11/12/19, 1:49:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: You said today you would tell me. Right? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/12/19, 1:49:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Don‚Äôt judge me. I‚Äôm highly looking forward to it. It‚Äôs just that haha.
[11/12/19, 2:00:23 PM] Luc: The reason I wanted to sleep on it was because I thought of a lot of possibilities, and I felt that if I slept and woke up I'd be able to narrow it down
[11/12/19, 2:00:29 PM] Luc: Unfortunately it was the opposite
[11/12/19, 2:01:37 PM] Luc: Here are some things I would like to do on a nice afternoon
[11/12/19, 2:03:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Don‚Äôt worry. We can choose one and leave the others for some other day.
[11/12/19, 2:05:00 PM] Luc: Drink a mate/have a picnic in Parque de la Memoria
Go to MALBA and then wander around in Palermo Chico
Wander around the Chacarita Cemetery (I think it closes at 5 though)
Go to the Planetario (I've never been!)
Go to La Viruta and watch awkward older couples try to save their marriages via tango lessons
Walk around the Reserva Ecologica in Puerto Madero
Go to the Hipodromo and watch a Polo Match or Horse Race
Go to BA Jazz (this doesn't start until Thursday, unfortunately)
[11/12/19, 2:07:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh my
[11/12/19, 2:07:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: What a difficult choice haha
[11/12/19, 2:07:55 PM] Luc: I'd say choose between 1, 2, 5, and 6
[11/12/19, 2:24:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Watching older couples try to save their marriages sounds like fun tho
[11/12/19, 2:24:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/12/19, 2:28:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh. That was number 5.
[11/12/19, 2:28:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Apparently I don‚Äôt know how to count haha. I‚Äôm sorry.
[11/12/19, 2:35:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: 2 or 6 sound good if the day is nice. If not (or if it gets late) I‚Äôm all in for La Viruta.
[11/12/19, 2:39:54 PM] Luc: oh my god, it's the best
[11/12/19, 2:40:02 PM] Luc: and it makes total sense
[11/12/19, 2:40:13 PM] Luc: they're like "we need to bring some spark back to our marriage, let's take tango lessons!"
[11/12/19, 2:40:27 PM] Luc: and then they go and actually what happens is that they fall in love with other people
[11/12/19, 2:40:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: This is so sad!
[11/12/19, 2:41:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve been there, but I was little. I didn‚Äôt appreciate all this haha.
[11/12/19, 2:41:38 PM] Luc: You have to watch out for the older women with the animal print leggings.
[11/12/19, 2:41:46 PM] Luc: They're on the hunt for younger men
[11/12/19, 2:43:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ok. I‚Äôm already googling the address.
[11/12/19, 2:43:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/12/19, 2:43:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: You have to watch out then, not me.
[11/12/19, 2:43:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÇ
[11/12/19, 2:44:02 PM] Luc: it's on armenia
[11/12/19, 2:44:29 PM] Luc: between gorriti and honduras? or between cabrera and gorriti.
[11/12/19, 2:45:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: One more. Niceto Vega and Cabrera.
[11/12/19, 2:47:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Or one less, depending where you are coming from)
[11/12/19, 2:49:57 PM] Luc: Aha!
[11/12/19, 2:50:14 PM] Luc: You know I'll play this game with you all day
[11/12/19, 2:50:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: You really don‚Äôt want me to come? Just say it
[11/12/19, 2:50:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: üò≠
[11/12/19, 2:51:07 PM] Luc: hahah what! of course I do
[11/12/19, 2:51:20 PM] Luc: I was referring to the "where are things located by memory game"
[11/12/19, 2:51:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh. Thought you meant the ‚Äúwhich street comes next game‚Äù.
[11/12/19, 2:52:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: I will never win to that one
[11/12/19, 2:54:29 PM] Luc: Well, tango doesn't usually start until a bit later (do you dance tango?)
[11/12/19, 3:05:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: The only time I danced tango was when I was there. Like 10 years ago. Do you?
[11/12/19, 3:06:03 PM] Luc: Thank goodness. I do not. Other than to know the 7 basic steps
[11/12/19, 3:08:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Don‚Äôt let me stay up to 21 hs (9 pm haha) tho. Cause there are rock classes. And I love it.
[11/12/19, 3:09:03 PM] Luc: on wednesdays, there?
[11/12/19, 3:09:16 PM] Luc: I thought it was like milongas all night
[11/12/19, 3:09:33 PM] Luc: and occasionally the incredible colombian guys get in front and lead a group dance
[11/12/19, 3:09:50 PM] Luc: Either way I sort of just sit there and watch and drink my wine, I'm easily entertained :))
[11/12/19, 3:11:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: You‚Äôve been there plenty of times, right?
[11/12/19, 3:11:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/12/19, 3:11:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sounds really good
[11/12/19, 3:11:52 PM] Luc: I used to go with Will and we would just sit there and get a little saucy
[11/12/19, 3:15:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Saucy haha
[11/12/19, 3:15:47 PM] Luc: I probably haven't been in a year or more, sadly
[11/12/19, 3:16:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs a plan then
[11/12/19, 3:17:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: We can wander around if it‚Äôs too early. And then go.
[11/12/19, 3:17:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: What do you say?
[11/12/19, 3:17:42 PM] Luc: Perfect
[11/12/19, 3:18:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: At what time will you be free?
[11/12/19, 3:18:50 PM] Luc: From about 6pm onwards, if that's okay?
[11/12/19, 3:24:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: I could be taking the bus at that time. So I would actually get to Palermo around 6.45.
[11/12/19, 3:24:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: üò™
[11/12/19, 3:27:45 PM] Luc: Would you prefer earlier, later, or that time?
[11/12/19, 3:27:51 PM] Luc: Just let me know and I can be flexible :)
[11/12/19, 3:36:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Let‚Äôs say 7
[11/12/19, 3:39:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Just in case I get delayed.
[11/12/19, 3:39:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: You know I enjoy being hit by cars and stuff. üòÖ
[11/12/19, 3:40:53 PM] Luc: Of course
[11/12/19, 3:41:13 PM] Luc: And let's say Plaza Armenia so we can enjoy a bit of the sunset sky
[11/12/19, 3:41:40 PM] Luc: I'll bring you something caffeinated and something sweet so you don't fall asleep on me, sound alright?
[11/12/19, 4:08:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: You are amazing.
[11/12/19, 4:11:32 PM] Luc: At best it's a small gesture
[11/12/19, 4:12:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I won‚Äôt get there empty handed knowing that.
[11/12/19, 4:13:32 PM] Luc: As you wish, but really you needn't bring anything but yourself
[11/12/19, 4:20:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: I will have to think it thoroughly. Cause I only know about your love for peaches by now.
[11/12/19, 4:21:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I‚Äôll do my best
[11/12/19, 4:22:56 PM] Luc: fruit is a great idea
[11/12/19, 4:33:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Consider it done (:
[11/12/19, 5:30:11 PM] Luc: 5:30 happy end of work message
[11/12/19, 5:40:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÅüòÅüòÅ
[11/12/19, 5:41:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Thanks!
[11/12/19, 5:41:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm not sure at what time should I wish you that..
[11/12/19, 5:45:19 PM] Luc: I just returned home from the gym
[11/12/19, 5:45:33 PM] Luc: I'll shower and keep working
[11/12/19, 5:45:47 PM] Luc: I just sort of work between requests
[11/12/19, 5:49:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Then happy return home from the gym message ‚ò∫
[11/12/19, 5:51:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: I have to stop by a bookshop for my boss before going to classes. That it‚Äôs a really bad idea for sb like me. I‚Äôll be soooo late.
[11/12/19, 5:59:50 PM] Luc: Thanks. Best feeling ever to take a cold shower üôåüèº
‚Äé[11/12/19, 6:01:32 PM] Luc: ‚Äéaudio omitted
[11/12/19, 6:10:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: I prefer physical books as well
[11/12/19, 6:11:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: But it makes a lot of sense. Not wanting to collect way too many things while renting, I mean.
[11/12/19, 9:20:22 PM] Luc: How's class?
[11/12/19, 9:28:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Great! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs that I really enjoy this subject or that there is only one class left. But it‚Äôs passing very quickly.
[11/12/19, 9:28:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: How about your night?
[11/12/19, 9:48:01 PM] Luc: Nice :) did a bunch of cooking and some reading and hoping to get to bed a bit earlier than usual
[11/12/19, 9:58:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Roger that
[11/12/19, 9:58:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Promise not to bother til too late
[11/12/19, 10:02:59 PM] Luc: No no not at all
[11/12/19, 10:38:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: I believe I could actually eat a horse right now.
[11/12/19, 10:39:03 PM] Luc: That's very mongol of you
[11/12/19, 10:40:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt know they actually eat horses.
[11/12/19, 10:42:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I‚Äôll probably have some milanesas. Didn‚Äôt get to that point yet.
[11/12/19, 10:42:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/12/19, 10:48:51 PM] Luc: Horsemeat milanesas, yum
[11/12/19, 10:51:07 PM] Luc: Made it home?
[11/12/19, 10:51:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Biiiig fan of milanesas here. But I don‚Äôt think I would have those ones haha.
[11/12/19, 10:51:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not yet
‚Äé[11/12/19, 11:10:19 PM] Luc: ‚Äéaudio omitted
[11/12/19, 11:12:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/12/19, 11:12:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: I laughed, then I didn‚Äôt, and then I did again.
[11/12/19, 11:13:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: Making horse inside a horse. That‚Äôs terrible. Resourceful tho.
[11/12/19, 11:14:34 PM] Luc: If you felt inclined to not talk to me again I would be disappointed but I'd also understand fully
[11/12/19, 11:20:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Are u kidding? 1. I enjoy listening to you (no matter the content) 2. I love those fun (not so fun) facts.
[11/12/19, 11:21:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: So.. if you were trying to get rid of me, you‚Äôll have to try harder.
[11/12/19, 11:25:59 PM] Luc: Oh I'm glad, there are (un)fortunately many more where that came from
[11/12/19, 11:26:35 PM] Luc: Though I'm not sure in which unwell part of my brain I have stored the most absurd things
[11/12/19, 11:32:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/12/19, 11:32:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Keep them coming
[11/12/19, 11:38:49 PM] Luc: _Now_ are you home?
[11/12/19, 11:49:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: I am
[11/12/19, 11:49:12 PM] Luc: What's the routine?
[11/12/19, 11:49:37 PM] Luc: Shower, comfy clothes, food, dishes, ironing, bed?
[11/12/19, 11:51:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Comfy clothes before anything, washing machine, food (and food for tomorrow‚Äôs lunch), dishes, bed.
[11/12/19, 11:52:05 PM] Luc: Are you a morning shower girl?
[11/12/19, 11:52:08 PM] Luc: Or a
[11/12/19, 11:52:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: I had to change my routine and shower in the morning. So that I don‚Äôt get to bed so late.
[11/12/19, 11:52:12 PM] Luc: Whenever i can
[11/12/19, 11:52:16 PM] Luc: Aha
[11/12/19, 11:52:29 PM] Luc: You deserve a medal
[11/12/19, 11:53:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: And to force myself to wake up in the morning haha
[11/12/19, 11:53:16 PM] Luc: .
[11/12/19, 11:53:39 PM] Luc: I'll start asking around if anyone here does smelting
[11/12/19, 11:53:55 PM] Luc: Tonight was your last class of which course?
[11/12/19, 11:54:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt know what smelting is. But after the horse thing, I‚Äôm not sure I wanna ask.
[11/12/19, 11:54:41 PM] Luc: Melting and reforming metals and alloys
[11/12/19, 11:54:52 PM] Luc: üòõ
[11/12/19, 11:55:02 PM] Luc: To make you a proper medal
[11/12/19, 11:55:09 PM] Luc: for your unparalleled service
[11/12/19, 11:55:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha
[11/12/19, 11:55:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not even close to that
[11/12/19, 11:56:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Language IV. Basically, translation into English.
[11/12/19, 11:56:35 PM] Luc: You're a war hero but you battle a lack of sleep and long commutes
[11/12/19, 11:56:37 PM] Luc: Ahh
[11/12/19, 11:56:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: I have one more class actually, but this was the last ‚Äúserious‚Äù one, we won‚Äôt do much next.
[11/12/19, 11:57:51 PM] Luc: Your classmates who've already graduated, what do they end up doing?
[11/12/19, 11:57:57 PM] Luc: Slightly off topic but I'm curious
[11/13/19, 12:00:25 AM] Luc: Arrancamos de nuevo
[11/13/19, 12:00:43 AM] Anita Zuddio: Bien que me avisaste porque no me hab√≠a dado cuenta de la hora
[11/13/19, 12:01:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Muchos no terminaron a√∫n. Pero de los que si, algunos trabajan en empresas que requieren ingl√©s. Aunque no como traductores.
[11/13/19, 12:01:56 AM] Anita Zuddio: Otros traducen/interpretan freelance y trabajan estable de otra cosa.
[11/13/19, 12:02:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: Lo que probablemente haga yo tan pronto me reciba.
[11/13/19, 12:02:58 AM] Luc: Pero pens√© que disfrutaba lo que haces
[11/13/19, 12:03:33 AM] Luc: O sea, que por lo menos trabajas por una familia generosa y relativamente buena
[11/13/19, 12:03:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: Seguro! Ah√≠ me refer√≠a
[11/13/19, 12:03:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: No me expliqu√© bien
[11/13/19, 12:04:09 AM] Anita Zuddio: Me encanta traducir, pero es dif√≠cil empezar como freelance.
[11/13/19, 12:04:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: Y no se si podr√≠a tampoco vivir sin saber si llego a cubrir los gastos a fin de mes.
[11/13/19, 12:05:39 AM] Luc: Hahahaha despu√©s de ayer y hoy con el tema del incertidumbre sobre nuestra salida, creo que entiendo
[11/13/19, 12:06:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: Por eso entr√© donde trabajo. Que si bien no traduzco casi nada, es un buen trabajo. Y una vez que termine la facultad, voy a aprovechar lo que me quede del d√≠a al salir de la oficina para sumar traducciones freelance.
[11/13/19, 12:06:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: Por lo menos hasta encontrar para donde quiero seguir.
[11/13/19, 12:06:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: No me puedo defender üò™
[11/13/19, 12:06:58 AM] Luc: Aj√°
[11/13/19, 12:07:20 AM] Luc: Es un buen plan
[11/13/19, 12:08:21 AM] Luc: Y lo de las NNUU?
[11/13/19, 12:08:33 AM] Luc: Se lo escribe as√≠?
[11/13/19, 12:11:51 AM] Anita Zuddio: La ONU, dir√≠a
[11/13/19, 12:12:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: (Pero el criterio que tuviste para la sigla estuvo bien)
[11/13/19, 12:13:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: Tengo que dar un examen el a√±o que viene. Y si paso, quedo en un pool de aplicantes para los puestos que se abran.
[11/13/19, 12:13:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: Osea, puede demorar a√±os. Y todo esto es si apruebo.
[11/13/19, 12:14:34 AM] Luc: aprob√°s, olvid√°te
[11/13/19, 12:19:01 AM] Luc: y bueno, como tus compa√±eros de la facultad, tendr√°s la oportunidad de trabajar en empresas que necesitan gente que habla ingles
[11/13/19, 12:19:21 AM] Luc: me parece muy util
[11/13/19, 12:21:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Lo es, pero creo que cada vez m√°s gente lo habla muy bien. As√≠ que no se si es un GRAN asset por si solo.
[11/13/19, 12:22:16 AM] Luc: no pero, cada vez mas obligatorio
[11/13/19, 12:22:51 AM] Luc: o sea, lo que decis es que no compet√≠s solamente por poder decir "hablo y escribo perfectamente"
[11/13/19, 12:22:54 AM] Luc: y tiene sentido
[11/13/19, 12:24:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exacto. Si desde la traducci√≥n. Eso no es para cualquiera que maneje el idioma. Pero solo por hablarlo no.
[11/13/19, 12:25:09 AM] Anita Zuddio: Tendr√© que ver si me especializo en algun √°rea. Y cual, ese es el punto m√°s dif√≠cil. Pero clave.
[11/13/19, 12:25:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: En fin. Vos est√°s por dormir? No quiero detenerte.
[11/13/19, 12:27:21 AM] Luc: Estuve y ahora no
[11/13/19, 12:27:33 AM] Luc: Leyendo noticias sensacionales
[11/13/19, 12:27:43 AM] Luc: Lo de la chica Brenda

[11/13/19, 12:31:43 AM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajajajaja
[11/13/19, 12:32:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Excelente
[11/13/19, 12:32:37 AM] Luc: esta historia
[11/13/19, 12:32:38 AM] Luc: que locura
[11/13/19, 12:33:15 AM] Luc: por un lado s√© que es muy injusto que ella y nahir reciban tanta atencion mientras muchas mujeres mueren por femicidio
[11/13/19, 12:33:32 AM] Luc: por el otro lado, jesus, con tijeras de podar?
[11/13/19, 12:35:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: Estoy muy de acuerdo
[11/13/19, 12:35:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: Con ambas cosas
[11/13/19, 12:35:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: La segunda sobre todo
[11/13/19, 12:35:35 AM] Luc: estoy experimentando un dolor por proxy
[11/13/19, 12:35:47 AM] Luc: por transferencia
[11/13/19, 12:36:54 AM] Anita Zuddio: Me es inimaginable lo doloroso que puede ser algo as√≠.
[11/13/19, 12:37:16 AM] Luc: üôä
[11/13/19, 12:38:06 AM] Luc: crees que hay mas drama o histerica aca que en otros paises?
[11/13/19, 12:39:37 AM] Luc: drama per capita, digamos
[11/13/19, 12:40:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm. No se si es comparable. Entiendo que en lugares en crisis importantes debe ser igual o peor.
[11/13/19, 12:41:34 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pero si es cierto que ac√° la gente est√° cada vez m√°s alterada.
[11/13/19, 12:42:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: Y no le veo vuelta atr√°s a eso en el corto plazo.
[11/13/19, 12:42:45 AM] Luc: Me parece que hay una tendencia de "sensacionalizar" mucho
[11/13/19, 12:43:14 AM] Luc: Por eso intento evitar ver las noticias (aunque sea muy dificil cuando voy al gym porque hay TVs por todos lados)
[11/13/19, 12:44:02 AM] Luc: Porque de verdad ver las noticias me da miedo. Y muestran todo, robos, muertos, videos filtrados, hasta el punto que parece que no hay decencia
[11/13/19, 12:44:21 AM] Luc: este caso es un ejemplo entre muchos
[11/13/19, 12:49:02 AM] Anita Zuddio: Es muy cierto. Y solo contribuye m√°s a lo que te dec√≠a. Mucha gente la est√° pasando mal y lo que ven en la tv solo alimenta eso. Y as√≠ andamos, topandonos con gente s√∫per alterada en todos los √°mbitos.
[11/13/19, 12:49:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: Me apena mucho. Y me preocupa tambi√©n.
[11/13/19, 12:50:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: No ibas para ese lado con la pregunta, creo. No?
[11/13/19, 12:51:13 AM] Luc: la pregunta provoca lo que provoca
[11/13/19, 12:56:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Eso es cierto
[11/13/19, 12:56:42 AM] Luc: hahah
[11/13/19, 12:56:44 AM] Luc: sorry
[11/13/19, 12:56:57 AM] Luc: no tenia nada mas profundo a agregarle a la conversaci√≥n
[11/13/19, 12:57:25 AM] Luc: ademas de las noticias
[11/13/19, 12:57:32 AM] Luc: todo me parece un poco mas dramatizado ac√°
[11/13/19, 12:57:40 AM] Luc: los talk shows, por ejemplo
[11/13/19, 12:57:48 AM] Luc: las peliculas
[11/13/19, 12:58:23 AM] Luc: las hinchadas
[11/13/19, 1:00:16 AM] Luc: queria que la idea del "hot blooded latin" sea un esterotipo, pero se nota. obviamente tiene mucho mas que ver con la cultura en la cual uno crece
[11/13/19, 1:01:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: Seguro. Quiz√°s por eso no lo noto tanto tambi√©n.
[11/13/19, 1:01:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: Los talk shows si. Hace siglos que no paso por esos canales en la tv.
[11/13/19, 1:02:03 AM] Luc: siglos? dale vampire
[11/13/19, 1:02:05 AM] Anita Zuddio: Porque todo me parece demasiado
[11/13/19, 1:02:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja
[11/13/19, 1:02:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: Crei que ya estaba claro que me gusta exagerar
[11/13/19, 1:03:28 AM] Luc: est√° bien I like vampires :)
[11/13/19, 1:06:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: El libro que estoy leyendo en este momento es sobre eso justo
[11/13/19, 1:06:48 AM] Luc: Cual es?
[11/13/19, 1:06:50 AM] Luc: TWILIGHT
[11/13/19, 1:08:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja ser√© girly pero no llegue a tanto
[11/13/19, 1:10:02 AM] Anita Zuddio: La historiadora, se llama. Es novela, pero parte de la historia.. real?? de Vlad el empalador.
[11/13/19, 1:10:48 AM] Luc: !!!
[11/13/19, 1:11:09 AM] Luc: Te dije que fui a Rumania?
[11/13/19, 1:11:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: Nop
[11/13/19, 1:12:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pero ya sabemos de que viaje me vas a contar ma√±ana üòÅ
[11/13/19, 1:12:56 AM] Luc: Tengo un par de amigos Rumanos muy cercanos
[11/13/19, 1:13:07 AM] Luc: Gente increible
[11/13/19, 1:13:18 AM] Luc: recomiendo que lo visites
[11/13/19, 1:14:13 AM] Luc: Es uno de los paises
[11/13/19, 1:14:18 AM] Luc: onda Argentina
[11/13/19, 1:14:30 AM] Luc: que es medio turbio a veces, caotico
[11/13/19, 1:14:45 AM] Luc: pero es esa energia caotica que lo hace especial
[11/13/19, 1:16:56 AM] Anita Zuddio: Me encanta
[11/13/19, 1:17:21 AM] Anita Zuddio: Tomo la recomendaci√≥n
[11/13/19, 1:19:04 AM] Luc: Reci√©n aprendi que Swaziland tiene otro nombre oficial
[11/13/19, 1:19:12 AM] Luc: (The Kingdom of) Eswatini
[11/13/19, 1:19:36 AM] Luc: ahora tengo que dormir, otro hecho inutil le agregu√© al cerebro
[11/13/19, 1:19:49 AM] Luc: pero re buen nombre no?
[11/13/19, 7:58:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: Perd√≥n! Perd√≠ totalmente la habilidad de resistir despierta aparentemente.
[11/13/19, 7:58:09 AM] Anita Zuddio: Gran nombre!

[11/13/19, 12:41:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: No lo dije por cambiar el plan eh, solo me gusta m√°s que no llueva jaja
[11/13/19, 12:45:57 PM] Luc: Tranqui :)
[11/13/19, 12:46:01 PM] Luc: C√≥mo te va el d√≠a?

[11/13/19, 3:25:02 PM] Luc: fuiste alguna vez al microteatro?
[11/13/19, 3:25:58 PM] Luc: queda en serrano, cruzando cordoba. pens√© que si te interesa, vamos ah√≠ para ver unas obracitas, y despues a la viruta

[11/13/19, 3:38:39 PM] Luc: es que, la viruta abre a las 8, y se que hara poca gente a esa hora
[11/13/19, 3:39:16 PM] Luc: as√≠ pense que matamos una hora en microteatro y despues vamos ya que quedan a unas cuadras
[11/13/19, 3:55:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: No te preocupes por eso, con llegar a planchar me alcanza üòÇ

[11/13/19, 5:06:06 PM] Luc: Sos la experta pero talvez te convenga tambi√©n tomar el 68 hasta bot√°nico?
[11/13/19, 5:09:04 PM] Luc: Opciones a rolete
[11/13/19, 5:09:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si, pens√© en subte en verdad
[11/13/19, 5:09:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero desde Cabildo hay m√°s cuadras a la plaza, tardar√≠a en la caminata.

[11/13/19, 7:01:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Estoy pensando que ser√≠a justo darte un break a mitad de salida y que pasemos al ingl√©s.
[11/13/19, 7:01:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: No quiero agotarte

[11/14/19, 2:22:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: If we‚Äôre gonna repeat, please let‚Äôs do it during the weekend tho. I don‚Äôt know if I can take more than one night up until this late haha.
[11/14/19, 2:23:06 AM] Luc: I have exactly zero problems with that idea
[11/14/19, 2:23:12 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/14/19, 2:23:31 AM] Luc: If you can find an open moment in your weekend, let me know :)
[11/14/19, 2:23:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: Thank you. For the whole evening.
[11/14/19, 2:23:36 AM] Luc: If not no problem at all

[11/14/19, 2:40:43 AM] Luc: But I'll just come home and nap if I can. Usually I can't nap though
[11/14/19, 2:40:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve just realized that I have what was left of the sweet treats in my bag. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ I‚Äôm sorry.

[11/14/19, 2:50:55 AM] Luc: Bed?
[11/14/19, 2:51:21 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. Getting ready as we speak.
[11/14/19, 2:51:25 AM] Luc: See
[11/14/19, 2:51:31 AM] Luc: All before 3am
[11/14/19, 2:51:38 AM] Luc: Easy peasy
[11/14/19, 2:52:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly. Who needs more than 4 hours of sleep?
[11/14/19, 2:52:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/14/19, 2:52:24 AM] Luc: Well lots of people but apparently not Anita
[11/14/19, 2:52:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha we‚Äôll see about that tomorrow.
[11/14/19, 2:53:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sleep tight
[11/14/19, 2:53:41 AM] Luc: Thank you, you too!
[11/14/19, 2:53:45 AM] Luc: Sweet dreams :)
[11/14/19, 2:53:51 AM] Anita Zuddio: üòò
[11/14/19, 2:53:54 AM] Luc: Besito
[11/14/19, 7:04:10 AM] Luc: Well, good morning. Hope you're not awake yet, but somehow I woke up feeling awesome so for now I'll just start my day and wait for the impending crash üôÉ
[11/14/19, 7:50:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: Morning! (:
[11/14/19, 7:51:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm glad to read that!
[11/14/19, 7:51:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: I also woke up full of energy. I don‚Äôt know how long this will last tho haha.
[11/14/19, 7:54:14 AM] Luc: Start the coffee IV drip
[11/14/19, 8:08:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha that would be such a good idea
[11/14/19, 8:08:39 AM] Luc: I'll make a few phone calls üòâ
[11/14/19, 8:10:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Was this for the coffee IV or are you making some work calls? ü§î
[11/14/19, 8:10:54 AM] Luc: Hahaha it was a joke about the coffee IV
[11/14/19, 8:11:05 AM] Luc: It's 3am in SF so there shall be zero work calls
[11/14/19, 8:15:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Makes sense haha
[11/14/19, 8:15:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: I did get a call from my mom just now. Waaaay too early haha.
[11/14/19, 8:16:32 AM] Luc: Ugh yes
[11/14/19, 8:17:03 AM] Luc: It's actually kinda funny cause I usually stay up much later and occasionally I'll chat with my mom at night time her time and it's 1 or 2am for me
[11/14/19, 8:19:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: Just because? I mean, why not earlier? haha
[11/14/19, 8:19:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: My day began with my sunglasses on. I‚Äôm pretty close to a vampire right now.
[11/14/19, 8:19:52 AM] Luc: Cause she sometimes has a client until 6 or 7 her time. And I'm awake anyway so no big deal
[11/14/19, 8:20:06 AM] Luc: Hope your boss is in a good mood today
[11/14/19, 8:21:02 AM] Anita Zuddio: So do I!
[11/14/19, 8:29:35 AM] Luc: She types... She untypes...
[11/14/19, 8:29:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: So far so good. She got me nuts from her mother‚Äôs house. I‚Äôll have to find some good recipe to make use of them (I always say that and end up making banana bread haha).
[11/14/19, 8:30:12 AM] Luc: From your grandmothers house, that is?
[11/14/19, 8:30:18 AM] Luc: Oh wait
[11/14/19, 8:30:20 AM] Luc: Your boss?
[11/14/19, 8:30:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, a Grammar freak. when I‚Äôm not sure if what I‚Äôm saying is ok. I paraphrase.
[11/14/19, 8:30:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap haha
[11/14/19, 8:31:00 AM] Luc: Nueces I guess?
[11/14/19, 8:31:14 AM] Luc: Nuts is one of these words with confusing translation
[11/14/19, 9:38:55 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly
[11/14/19, 9:39:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: Cause it also works for ‚Äúfrutos secos‚Äù in general u mean?
[11/14/19, 10:19:14 AM] Luc: Yes precisely
[11/14/19, 11:13:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah. You are right. It‚Äôs quite confusing.
[11/14/19, 11:13:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: Good luck with your appointment!
[11/14/19, 12:29:36 PM] Luc: Hi
[11/14/19, 12:29:57 PM] Luc: Don't hate me but I'm arriving home and I might even take a nap üôä

[11/14/19, 12:38:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Do you use it or have it as decoration? It‚Äôs beautiful.
[11/14/19, 12:41:18 PM] Luc: I use it!
[11/14/19, 12:42:10 PM] Luc: I believe it's Saraswati
[11/14/19, 12:42:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Is it like marble?
[11/14/19, 12:42:34 PM] Luc: But she's usually shown with an instrument
[11/14/19, 12:42:43 PM] Luc: Yeah it's some kind of very solid stone haha
[11/14/19, 12:45:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm. You lost me there, I‚Äôm sorry.. A goddess I assume.
[11/14/19, 12:45:29 PM] Luc: Haha yes
[11/14/19, 12:45:42 PM] Luc: A relatively important one in the Hindu "pantheon"
[11/14/19, 12:50:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh, got it. I know so very little about the Hindu culture. I‚Äôm sorry.
[11/14/19, 12:51:04 PM] Luc: Nada nada que perdonar
[11/14/19, 1:18:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hey

[11/14/19, 1:22:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: During this time of the year we lunch in the garden.
[11/14/19, 1:22:31 PM] Luc: I like that you use lunch as a verb
[11/14/19, 1:22:35 PM] Luc: It's completely correct
[11/14/19, 1:22:42 PM] Luc: But sounds so formal
[11/14/19, 1:22:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm trying really hard not to fall asleep here.
[11/14/19, 1:22:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/14/19, 1:23:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Noted!
[11/14/19, 1:25:52 PM] Luc: I may or may not be in my bed with the AC blowing directly at me
[11/14/19, 1:25:59 PM] Luc: It's pretty close to heaven
[11/14/19, 1:26:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Show off
[11/14/19, 1:26:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/14/19, 1:26:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Enjoy!

[11/14/19, 1:41:00 PM] Luc: Yes ma'am
[11/14/19, 1:41:10 PM] Luc: Though I sort of can't
[11/14/19, 1:41:16 PM] Luc: I just have this like weird half sleep
[11/14/19, 1:41:41 PM] Luc: I'm sure you understand with your coffee habit üòò
[11/14/19, 1:43:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: I have no defense. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄüòÇ
[11/14/19, 1:47:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: But yes, I totally get it.
[11/14/19, 2:13:55 PM] Luc: Can we rewind to the time when we discovered we took the same photo of the same little waterfall?
[11/14/19, 2:14:13 PM] Luc: Am I the only one who thinks that's serendipitous and precious?
[11/14/19, 2:27:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: It definitely is
[11/14/19, 2:30:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: I love those little details and the fact that you enjoy them just as much makes me so happy haha.
[11/14/19, 3:52:59 PM] Luc: I just mean what are the chances??
[11/14/19, 3:53:45 PM] Luc: It's a tiny little waterfall up a crazy little path in a tiny town at the (almost) end of the world

[11/15/19, 1:43:49 PM] Luc: El chico con las manos pegajosas
[11/15/19, 1:43:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajaja
[11/15/19, 1:44:10 PM] Luc: Bueno
[11/15/19, 1:44:28 PM] Luc: Ese chico parec√≠a un asco total
[11/15/19, 1:45:09 PM] Luc: Luego encuentra su caramelo en su bolsillo completamente roto y cubierto con pelusa
[11/15/19, 1:45:14 PM] Luc: Nada
[11/15/19, 1:45:32 PM] Luc: Ese chico es CABA
[11/15/19, 1:45:45 PM] Luc: Es f√°cil verlo y pensar que sos tan diferente
[11/15/19, 1:46:08 PM] Luc: Pero realmente ese chico est√° viviendo en el momento y le chupa un huevo
[11/15/19, 1:46:29 PM] Luc: Y dentro de todos nosotros existe ese mismo chico sucio
[11/15/19, 1:46:40 PM] Luc: Y para poder disfrutar y entender la ciudad
[11/15/19, 1:46:58 PM] Luc: Hace falta que conectes con esa parte de tu mismo/a
[11/15/19, 1:47:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Okay.. y c√≥mo conectas con tu chico sucio interior?
[11/15/19, 1:48:05 PM] Luc: My inner dirty kid
[11/15/19, 1:48:46 PM] Luc: Surgi√≥ el pensamiento porque hab√≠a hablado con un amigo estadounidense y √©l se quej√≥
[11/15/19, 1:49:29 PM] Luc: Que no le gusta la ciudad y que es fea y sucia y tal (no es fea o sucia), es un gil de verdad
[11/15/19, 1:49:49 PM] Luc: Le quer√≠a preguntar
[11/15/19, 1:50:40 PM] Luc: Desde cu√°nto tiempo es perfecto como ser humano. Y porque si no es perfecto porque esperaria lo mismo de una ciudad llena de seres humanos
[11/15/19, 1:50:54 PM] Luc: Es? No me parece correcto
[11/15/19, 1:51:08 PM] Luc: Ha sido
[11/15/19, 1:51:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Desde cuando....
[11/15/19, 1:52:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Eso debe ser lo que te hizo dudar)
[11/15/19, 1:52:22 PM] Luc: Ahh dale
[11/15/19, 1:52:36 PM] Luc: Nada. Me cansan las conversaciones as√≠
[11/15/19, 1:52:58 PM] Luc: Con extranjeros esperando que yo tenga una respuesta
[11/15/19, 1:53:43 PM] Luc: No hay secreto
[11/15/19, 1:53:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es que ya sos un argentino m√°s
[11/15/19, 1:53:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: üëÜüèº
[11/15/19, 1:54:08 PM] Luc: Me parece que la soluci√≥n es dejar de estar tan serio
[11/15/19, 1:54:49 PM] Luc: Intentar re√≠rte de vez en cuando y hacer las cosas que te hacen feliz
[11/15/19, 1:57:13 PM] Luc: Y m√°s que nada
[11/15/19, 1:58:06 PM] Luc: Admit√≠ que existe tu chico sucio interior y am√°lo porque es un pibito re feliz y amigable
[11/15/19, 2:16:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: No puedo estar m√°s de acuerdo con esto.
[11/15/19, 2:16:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: De ah√≠ viene mi tatuaje
[11/15/19, 2:55:25 PM] Luc: Te pregunte c√≥mo te va el d√≠a?
[11/15/19, 3:03:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Muy tranquilo. Estoy ultimando reservas para el viaje de la otra semana.

[11/15/19, 3:07:36 PM] Luc: M√°s que nada porque dorm√≠ bien y por eso me puedo enfocar
[11/15/19, 3:08:05 PM] Luc: Y nada. A embarcar en el paseo
[11/15/19, 3:20:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me siento un poco responsable de que los √∫ltimos d√≠as no haya sido as√≠. Perd√≥n!
[11/15/19, 3:20:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que bien eso (: enjoy!

[11/18/19, 12:04:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha yeah, pretty much
[11/18/19, 12:05:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: And it doesn‚Äôt need to be a couch  either. I could easily fall asleep on the floor.
[11/18/19, 12:06:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Glad I stayed, it‚Äôs such an amazing day.
[11/18/19, 12:06:30 PM] Luc: You're lucky. I bet you can even sleep on airplanes
[11/18/19, 12:07:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh yes
[11/18/19, 12:08:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Eating and sleeping on the plane, the best.
[11/18/19, 12:08:54 PM] Luc: Unreal
‚Äé[11/18/19, 12:09:52 PM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/18/19, 12:13:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/18/19, 12:14:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: I must be one of the only persons who enjoy that probably.
[11/18/19, 12:16:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: So, how‚Äôs your day going?
[11/18/19, 12:16:57 PM] Luc: So far I'm just waking up and my brain isn't working
[11/18/19, 12:17:17 PM] Luc: Feeling rather confused about today cause it's a holiday here but not a holiday _there_
[11/18/19, 12:17:32 PM] Luc: My boss canceled our meeting so I'm just gonna pretend it's a holiday I think
[11/18/19, 12:27:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/18/19, 12:27:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sounds good
[11/18/19, 12:28:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Any holiday plans?
[11/18/19, 12:28:49 PM] Luc: Wander I guess
[11/18/19, 12:28:53 PM] Luc: Clean
[11/18/19, 12:29:18 PM] Luc: And you?
[11/18/19, 12:39:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Right now mates by the pool. But it‚Äôs supposed to rain, so I‚Äôll probably head back home after lunch.
[11/18/19, 12:55:31 PM] Luc: The high life ü•Ç
[11/18/19, 12:55:40 PM] Luc: Hey unrelated related question
[11/18/19, 12:55:47 PM] Luc: When do I get to see you again?
[11/18/19, 1:08:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha yeah, but just for a while. I can‚Äôt stay way too long under the sun ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/18/19, 1:09:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Good question
[11/18/19, 1:11:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: From Tuesday til Thursday I won‚Äôt have much time, between work and school. But any other day, I‚Äôm in.
[11/18/19, 1:12:23 PM] Luc: Do ya burn?
[11/18/19, 1:14:15 PM] Luc: Maybe Friday then, or during the weekend? I'd say today but I should really take a break and get some work done.
[11/18/19, 1:15:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: I very much do.
[11/18/19, 1:15:52 PM] Luc: Oh wait this coming weekend I'm in Tigre Saturday + Night
[11/18/19, 1:16:07 PM] Luc: And you're gone too no?
[11/18/19, 1:17:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Friday night? Saturday morning I‚Äôm leaving.
[11/18/19, 1:17:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly
[11/18/19, 1:18:16 PM] Luc: This sounds dangerous
[11/18/19, 1:18:33 PM] Luc: Like a good way for me to set you up for the sleepiest trip of your life
[11/18/19, 1:19:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha yeah, I know. But I‚Äôll be gone for a week. I wouldn‚Äôt wanna wait that long.
[11/18/19, 1:19:35 PM] Luc: Whoa so long!
[11/18/19, 1:19:50 PM] Luc: Well hey it was nice knowing you
[11/18/19, 1:20:00 PM] Luc: üòõ
[11/18/19, 1:25:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, by the time I‚Äôm back you‚Äôll probably have already met another cool Argentinian girl who enjoys having English/Spanish days and multiplan dates. üôÑ
[11/18/19, 1:25:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not cool
[11/18/19, 1:28:45 PM] Luc: "Multiplan" I guess is a good way to describe it
[11/18/19, 1:29:10 PM] Luc: You're gone Saturday to Saturday?
[11/18/19, 1:31:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha it was the best I could come up with
[11/18/19, 1:31:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Saturday to Friday
[11/18/19, 1:35:33 PM] Luc: Friday night it will have to be then
[11/18/19, 1:36:15 PM] Luc: But it's a bit too early to start thinking about the what and the where
[11/18/19, 1:42:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha yeah, it probably is.
[11/18/19, 1:42:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: But we have all week to come up with a good plan. üòÅ
[11/18/19, 6:00:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: How is your holiday not holiday going?
[11/18/19, 6:07:58 PM] Luc: It's so damn humid Anita
[11/18/19, 6:08:23 PM] Luc: I was cleaning my bathroom and I stood up and realized I was completely sweaty ü•µ
[11/18/19, 6:08:33 PM] Luc: But hey plus side I have a very clean shower to rinse off in
[11/18/19, 6:24:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: It is! üò∞
[11/18/19, 6:28:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha fair point
[11/18/19, 6:28:49 PM] Luc: How about you, back home?
[11/18/19, 6:29:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: I got my hair cut today and I haven‚Äôt checked how it looks yet cause I really don‚Äôt want to untie it.
[11/18/19, 6:30:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. Cooking and ironing for the week.
[11/18/19, 6:36:32 PM] Luc: OKAY BUT you can't say this AND then not show me

[11/18/19, 6:38:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha it‚Äôs just a lil bit shorter.

[11/18/19, 6:56:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/18/19, 6:56:39 PM] Luc: It looks great!
[11/18/19, 6:56:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Okay, that‚Äôs really creepy
[11/18/19, 6:56:57 PM] Luc: Is your natural color the brown, or the blonde? Or both
[11/18/19, 6:57:14 PM] Luc: La kretina te ama ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[11/18/19, 6:59:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: The brown. Dying part of it blonde is the wildest thing you‚Äôll ever see me do hair-wise haha.
[11/18/19, 7:00:42 PM] Luc: Wild is not a word I'd use to describe you and I'm thoroughly okay with that
[11/18/19, 7:00:55 PM] Luc: Did you ever dye it another color?
[11/18/19, 7:01:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha you are right
[11/18/19, 7:01:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Never. I wanted to get it dyed pink but I never did.
[11/18/19, 7:02:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I did use to have a dreadlock
[11/18/19, 7:02:39 PM] Luc: HAHAHA NO
[11/18/19, 7:02:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh yes
[11/18/19, 7:02:51 PM] Luc: One? Or several
[11/18/19, 7:02:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Just one
[11/18/19, 7:03:05 PM] Luc: I can't even
[11/18/19, 7:03:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: You didn‚Äôt expect that
[11/18/19, 7:03:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha
[11/18/19, 7:03:18 PM] Luc: I feel like that's the most anti Anita thing you could have revealed
[11/18/19, 7:03:37 PM] Luc: In fact I don't know if I've ever seen any Argentine woman with dreadlock(s)
[11/18/19, 7:03:59 PM] Luc: OH WAIT yes I have when I went to this "full moon party" outside of the planetarium. Jesus that was a scary night.
[11/18/19, 7:04:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: You probably have
[11/18/19, 7:04:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I really need you to tell me more about that some time.
[11/18/19, 7:04:40 PM] Luc: I've tried to suppress the memory
[11/18/19, 7:04:50 PM] Luc: I can say the same about your dreadlock
[11/18/19, 7:04:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs the very first time I hear about that
[11/18/19, 7:05:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Deal

[11/18/19, 9:07:54 PM] Luc: Hahaha no you're fine
[11/18/19, 9:08:01 PM] Luc: What's up?
[11/18/19, 9:08:11 PM] Luc: How are your tareas going
[11/18/19, 9:11:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Good. I‚Äôm done. Almost actually.. I should finish some stuff we are supposed to hand in on Thursday, but I can‚Äôt concentrate at all.
[11/18/19, 9:11:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: How about you?
[11/18/19, 9:11:59 PM] Luc: Thinking so much about me? I'm so sorry to distract you like this!
[11/18/19, 9:12:06 PM] Luc: I went for a nice lil walk
[11/18/19, 9:12:11 PM] Luc: And just made it home
[11/18/19, 9:13:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nice!
[11/18/19, 9:13:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha that must be it
[11/18/19, 9:15:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: About your modesty, more than anything
[11/18/19, 9:16:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm actually looking forward to Friday.. must admit. Whichever the plan.
[11/18/19, 9:30:01 PM] Luc: I think about how amazing and modest I am basically nonstop
[11/18/19, 9:30:13 PM] Luc: Se nota? üôä
[11/18/19, 9:30:27 PM] Luc: Me too!!
[11/18/19, 9:30:46 PM] Luc: What time on Saturday is your flight (or bus?)
[11/18/19, 9:33:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: 8 am üòì
[11/18/19, 9:37:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: No, wait. 8.55.
[11/18/19, 9:41:37 PM] Luc: Not much better
[11/18/19, 9:41:42 PM] Luc: Aeroparque I hope
[11/18/19, 9:41:49 PM] Luc: And not Retiro
[11/18/19, 9:47:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yes, aeroparque
[11/18/19, 9:49:38 PM] Luc: Aha
[11/18/19, 9:50:10 PM] Luc: Okay, so like, that's a no to _meta joda meta cumbia_?
[11/18/19, 9:56:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well, that depends on what you mean by meta joda meta cumbia. But I‚Äôd rather save that plan for some other time.
[11/18/19, 9:56:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[11/18/19, 9:59:07 PM] Luc: It's like the best song ever
[11/18/19, 9:59:15 PM] Luc: Soltero hasta la tumba
[11/18/19, 9:59:48 PM] Luc: Okay so maybe something a little more tranqui
[11/18/19, 9:59:56 PM] Luc: I'll noodle on it
[11/18/19, 10:01:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I know. I told you I know my cumbia.
[11/18/19, 10:02:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, that would be wise.
[11/18/19, 10:02:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry!
‚Äé[11/18/19, 10:03:11 PM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/18/19, 10:03:29 PM] Luc: Apologize not!
[11/18/19, 10:09:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt like making it so difficult to make a simple plan.
[11/18/19, 10:09:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: It took me ages, and still it didn‚Äôt came out as I wanted. But I hope you got what I meant.
[11/18/19, 10:10:48 PM] Luc: Hahaha you're not making it difficult at all
[11/18/19, 10:11:01 PM] Luc: You have to wake up early so I will make sure we aren't out too late that's all
[11/18/19, 10:11:12 PM] Luc: Don't worry! üòò
[11/18/19, 10:12:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: You rock haha
[11/18/19, 10:13:21 PM] Luc: Not at all! I just understand you'll need as much energy as you can get to deal with a bunch of preteens for a week
[11/18/19, 10:13:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: (I won‚Äôt say that too often tho, won‚Äôt help with all that modesty)
[11/18/19, 10:14:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I have the weekend to get ready for that. The trip with them begins on Monday.
[11/18/19, 10:14:38 PM] Luc: Ohhhh pfff
[11/18/19, 10:15:01 PM] Luc: So why exactly did you pick a Saturday morning flight? I mean was there a reason
[11/18/19, 10:15:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: The next one was on Sunday evening. Should anything go wrong with that one, I wouldn‚Äôt make it to the trip.
[11/18/19, 10:16:21 PM] Luc: Ahhh the old hedged bet
[11/18/19, 10:16:40 PM] Luc: Very wise and very Argentine all at the same time üòõ
[11/18/19, 10:16:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/18/19, 10:17:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm actually good with it cause I get to spend two days all by myself at my bosses‚Äô estate.
[11/18/19, 10:18:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm not so sure if that‚Äôs the word.. ranch maybe. Whatever.
[11/18/19, 10:18:41 PM] Luc: Estate life eh
[11/18/19, 10:18:45 PM] Luc: Hacienda?
[11/18/19, 10:19:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, but giganormous
[11/18/19, 10:19:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Like 19 hectares or so.
[11/18/19, 10:19:54 PM] Luc: Probably a ranch then but it's all the same
[11/18/19, 10:20:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: Got it
[11/18/19, 10:33:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was already in my pjs and I got a message from a friend who‚Äôs feeling really sick at her (yet to be defined)‚Äòs place. So I might have come with her to the hospital if the doctor says so.
[11/18/19, 10:34:17 PM] Luc: Oh goodness
[11/18/19, 10:35:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: So if I disappear, it‚Äôs that she called to tell me where to go.
[11/18/19, 10:35:45 PM] Luc: I understand completely
[11/18/19, 10:36:06 PM] Luc: Let me know what's going on though! If you need help with anything
[11/18/19, 10:37:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Thanks!
[11/18/19, 10:40:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: It shouldn‚Äôt be anything serious, otherwise they would have told me to come immediately. But as I am the only one who knows about him, he contacted me just in case the doctor makes her get some tests or whatever.
[11/18/19, 10:41:36 PM] Luc: I'm really confused
[11/18/19, 10:41:43 PM] Luc: I guess you're saying
[11/18/19, 10:41:50 PM] Luc: She didn't feel comfortable telling her family
[11/18/19, 10:45:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry.
[11/18/19, 10:45:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap, exactly.
[11/18/19, 10:48:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: If she is taken to the hospital, she‚Äôd rather have me calling her family.
[11/18/19, 10:48:28 PM] Luc: Yeah I totally understand
[11/18/19, 10:48:52 PM] Luc: Well my goodness I hope she's okay ü§í
[11/18/19, 10:52:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: So do I! üò™

[11/18/19, 11:46:34 PM] Luc: I was watching the del ca√±o trap
[11/18/19, 11:49:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajaja
[11/18/19, 11:58:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: We do have some weird characters.
[11/18/19, 11:59:24 PM] Luc: The self-deprecating humor makes me happy :)
[11/19/19, 12:18:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Tenes TANTO de eso ac√°
[11/19/19, 12:19:11 AM] Luc: me cae muy bien
[11/19/19, 12:19:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: Lo malo de los feriados es que despu√©s cuesta m√°s arrancar la semana. Que fiaca amanecer temprano ma√±ana!

[11/19/19, 12:35:06 AM] Anita Zuddio: Entonces no seas muy flexible cuando se los pidas. Siempre ten√© en cuenta que aunque te digan que si, despu√©s hacen lo que tienen ganas. Es el modus operandi argentino. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/19/19, 12:35:34 AM] Luc: S√≠ :/

[11/19/19, 11:44:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: Si sirve de consuelo, yo estoy sin computadora en la oficina, conectada desde la de mi compa√±ero ahora. Y sin fotocopiadora. Se me rebelaron todas las m√°quinas el mismo d√≠a. üò™
[11/19/19, 12:16:14 PM] Luc: Oh no hahahaha
[11/19/19, 12:16:29 PM] Luc: Creo que voy a local a intentar a cancelar. Estoy pensando que
[11/19/19, 12:16:59 PM] Luc: Si llega algo y est√° da√±ado, raspado, lo que sea, ser√° otro quilombo total ya que s√© ahora que no son de confianza
[11/19/19, 12:36:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Eso es cierto..
[11/19/19, 12:36:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero la devoluci√≥n puede ser otro l√≠o tambi√©n.
[11/19/19, 12:42:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: F√≠jate pros y cons.
[11/19/19, 12:44:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Y av√≠same si te puedo ser √∫til, para llamarlos o lo que sea.
[11/19/19, 3:17:07 PM] Luc: No no, manejo todo yo, es mi cargo :)
[11/19/19, 3:17:16 PM] Luc: C√≥mo est√°s vos, Anita?
[11/19/19, 3:17:29 PM] Luc: Perd√≥n por haber empezado el d√≠a con tanta drama
[11/19/19, 3:17:44 PM] Luc: Necesitaba cafe√≠na!
[11/19/19, 3:24:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja t√©cnicamente soy asistente, as√≠ que no me molesta para nada asistirte si lo necesitas. üòÅ
[11/19/19, 3:24:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Bien, sin pc a√∫n, as√≠ que muy limitada en mis tareas üò™
[11/19/19, 3:26:00 PM] Luc: Que pas√≥ que te quedas sin todas las herramientas normales?
[11/19/19, 3:37:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mi computadora se restaur√≥ aparentemente. Como pas√≥ eso? No tengo idea.
[11/19/19, 3:38:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero o me instalan todo nuevamente en esta o me instalan todo en un nuevo CPU y me hacen el cambio. Cosa que todav√≠a no sucedi√≥ y me desespera un poco.
[11/19/19, 3:38:53 PM] Luc: Uf alta pena
[11/19/19, 3:39:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Porque justo mi jefa est√° de vacaciones. Y alguna deber√≠a estar en l√≠nea 24/7.
[11/19/19, 3:39:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Y al mismo tiempo se trab√≥ la fotocopiadora. Es como que toda la tecnolog√≠a de la oficina decidi√≥ morir al mismo tiempo üò™
[11/19/19, 3:39:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Solo me falta el tel√©fono
[11/19/19, 3:48:49 PM] Luc: üòï
[11/19/19, 3:49:03 PM] Luc: Y la drama de tu amiga de anoche, se solucion√≥?
[11/19/19, 3:56:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: No me contest√≥ los mensajes de hoy. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/19/19, 3:56:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es un cuelgue con el celular, pero quer√≠a que me diga si se siente mejor al menos.
[11/19/19, 3:56:26 PM] Luc: Eepa üòÆ
[11/19/19, 3:57:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Solo porque se que tiene una frecuencia de respuesta muuuuuy lenta, no me preocup√© a√∫n.
[11/19/19, 3:57:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero la voy a llamar a la salida sino.
[11/19/19, 3:58:17 PM] Luc: Viene el calor
[11/19/19, 3:58:22 PM] Luc: Y la drama del verano
[11/19/19, 3:59:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: No me gusta andar corrigiendo, pero este creo que lo vale porque sino no te vas a enterar nunca..
[11/19/19, 3:59:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es EL drama
[11/19/19, 3:59:57 PM] Luc: Ahhhhh deber√≠a haber sido
[11/19/19, 4:00:05 PM] Luc: Como tema
[11/19/19, 4:00:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: (No tiene explicaci√≥n gramatical igual, si fuera por eso, estar√≠as bien vos)
[11/19/19, 4:00:24 PM] Luc: Las que terminan -ma son masculinos
[11/19/19, 4:00:30 PM] Luc: O casi todas
[11/19/19, 4:00:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm, si, no lo tomes como regla, pero aplica en varios casos.
[11/19/19, 4:00:50 PM] Luc: El drama
[11/19/19, 4:00:52 PM] Luc: El drama
[11/19/19, 4:00:54 PM] Luc: El drama
[11/19/19, 4:00:56 PM] Luc: Ah√≠ est√°
[11/19/19, 4:01:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja
[11/19/19, 4:01:07 PM] Luc: üòò
[11/19/19, 4:01:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Tres veces y queda registrado en tu memoria?
[11/19/19, 4:01:09 PM] Luc: Gracias
[11/19/19, 4:01:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Anytime
[11/19/19, 4:01:38 PM] Luc: Mmm no pero podemos esperar
[11/19/19, 4:04:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajaja voy a usarlo todo lo posible para que te quede.
[11/19/19, 4:04:55 PM] Luc: You're the best
[11/19/19, 4:05:07 PM] Luc: Ser√° el drama del siglo
[11/19/19, 4:05:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Para, igual nos distraje con el pronombre y no te pregunt√© que quer√≠as decir con esto.
[11/19/19, 4:06:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: El drama del verano? Is that a thing? ü§î
[11/19/19, 4:07:12 PM] Luc: A full
[11/19/19, 4:07:23 PM] Luc: 100%
[11/19/19, 4:07:42 PM] Luc: Es la temporada de socializar, pileta, asado, lo que sea
[11/19/19, 4:07:59 PM] Luc: Ya empez√≥ ayer un drama!
[11/19/19, 4:09:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ahhh jajaja
[11/19/19, 4:10:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si, eso es cierto
[11/19/19, 4:10:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: El Luc cool y canchero est√° mas activo que nunca en esta √©poca?
[11/19/19, 4:11:02 PM] Luc: El Luc cool y canchero se cansa
[11/19/19, 4:11:14 PM] Luc: Se acuesta abajo del aire
[11/19/19, 4:11:18 PM] Luc: Y lee libros
[11/19/19, 4:17:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajajaja
[11/19/19, 4:17:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que bien me cae el Luc cool y canchero!
[11/19/19, 4:19:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Termino de pegar la entrada del museo del s√°bado en mi agenda ‚ò∫
[11/19/19, 4:19:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: No se si lo hablamos, pero tambi√©n uso agenda de papel todav√≠a. Adem√°s de la lista de compras.
[11/19/19, 4:20:02 PM] Luc: En Formosa?
[11/19/19, 4:20:12 PM] Luc: Hahaha habla con mi mam√° entonces
[11/19/19, 4:20:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: No jajaja. La del museo de cs naturales, del s√°bado pasado.
[11/19/19, 4:20:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Por qu√©? jajaja
[11/19/19, 4:21:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me la hago yo, todos los a√±os, es uno de mis mayores orgullos creo jaja.
[11/19/19, 4:22:24 PM] Luc: Ohhhh perd√≥n
[11/19/19, 4:22:30 PM] Luc: Silly me
[11/19/19, 4:22:52 PM] Luc: A ella tambi√©n le gusta su planner
[11/19/19, 4:22:58 PM] Luc: Lo lleva por todos lados
[11/19/19, 4:40:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajaja entonces si, tengo que hablar con ella.
[11/19/19, 4:40:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Same here
[11/19/19, 4:41:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: De hecho tendr√≠a que ir viendo telas para hacer la del a√±o que viene ya. üòÅ
[11/19/19, 5:06:57 PM] Luc: Telas? Haces tu propia?
[11/19/19, 5:09:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sip
[11/19/19, 5:09:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hice un curso de bookbinding
[11/19/19, 5:09:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Entonces elijo la tela, el interior y dem√°s y la hago.
[11/19/19, 5:24:41 PM] Luc: ü§ì
[11/19/19, 5:24:57 PM] Luc: Es copado
[11/19/19, 5:25:20 PM] Luc: Yo ni sab√≠a d√≥nde empezar
[11/19/19, 5:25:25 PM] Luc: Muy de crafts
[11/19/19, 5:26:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ya no debe sorprenderte jajaja
[11/19/19, 5:26:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Siii. Me encanta. Saber que de la nada terminas haciendo algo utilizable.
‚Äé[11/19/19, 5:34:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/19/19, 5:49:28 PM] Luc: Compras el interior y usando alg√∫n tipo de adhesivo pegas la tela?
[11/19/19, 5:49:38 PM] Luc: Est√° buen√≠simo
[11/19/19, 5:50:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Compro las hojas (ya impresas) y las coso con hilo. Compro cart√≥n y telas, hago las tapas con eso. Y despu√©s pego todo.
[11/19/19, 5:52:20 PM] Luc: Haces scrapbooking tambien?
[11/19/19, 5:52:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: No, pero me parece genial
[11/19/19, 5:54:35 PM] Luc: La evoluci√≥n natural de este hobby me parece :)
[11/19/19, 5:55:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Cuando tenga hijos, most probably jaja.
[11/19/19, 5:55:49 PM] Luc: Cuantos tendr√°s?
[11/19/19, 6:20:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Quien sabe..
[11/19/19, 6:20:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ojal√° uno por lo menos
[11/19/19, 6:26:42 PM] Luc: 6?
[11/19/19, 6:29:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es muy dif√≠cil planificar una familia con tantos hijos con nuestra econom√≠a. Pero hasta 4 te llego creo.
[11/19/19, 6:30:16 PM] Luc: Te hago una pregunta?
[11/19/19, 6:30:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja me asusta que preguntes antes de hacerla
[11/19/19, 6:30:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero dale
[11/19/19, 6:30:50 PM] Luc: üôÉ
[11/19/19, 6:32:36 PM] Luc: Crees que t√∫ propensi√≥n de planear, arreglar, ordenar, etc. es una reacci√≥n a tu ambiente (este pa√≠s tuyo que se presenta medio desordenado üôä), o es m√°s una cuesti√≥n de tu personalidad, tu naturaleza?
[11/19/19, 6:33:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Wow. Nunca lo pens√©.
[11/19/19, 6:33:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Creo que es m√°s de mi personalidad
[11/19/19, 6:33:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: el ambiente s√≥lo lo exacerba
[11/19/19, 6:35:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero a la vez me parece positivo ser as√≠ ac√°.
[11/19/19, 6:36:33 PM] Luc: Y tu carrera, entra tambi√©n en la lista de cosas ordenadas, literales, con respuestas fijas, no?
[11/19/19, 6:36:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nooo
‚Äé[11/19/19, 6:37:26 PM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/19/19, 6:37:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Justamente lo que menos me gusta traducir son textos jur√≠dicos tipo partidas, actas y dem√°s porque son b√°sicamente templates.
[11/19/19, 6:38:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: El desaf√≠o est√° en lo que menos sigue las estructuras.
[11/19/19, 6:38:16 PM] Luc: Oh exacto
[11/19/19, 6:38:31 PM] Luc: Y te da satisfacci√≥n poder encontrar la estructura correcta?
[11/19/19, 6:38:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Por eso tambi√©n hice interpretaci√≥n. Nunca vas a traducir dos veces lo mismo oralmente.
[11/19/19, 6:38:48 PM] Luc: Te pregunto no para criticarte, espero que no lo veas as√≠
[11/19/19, 6:39:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si, claramente. Soy obsesiva en que el resultado sea lo m√°s correcto posible estructuralmente
[11/19/19, 6:39:08 PM] Luc: Me pregunto porque talvez seas muy buena ingeniera üòõ
[11/19/19, 6:39:38 PM] Luc: Me/te same diff
[11/19/19, 6:43:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajaja
[11/19/19, 6:43:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Para nada. Solo que creo que con todo lo que dije hoy ya te espante for good jajajaja.
[11/19/19, 6:43:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Please like me anyways.
[11/19/19, 6:55:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: *anyway
[11/19/19, 7:21:32 PM] Luc: Casi! Haha no, no me espante. Pero ni hablamos de tejer üòâ
[11/19/19, 7:22:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ya lo mencion√©?
[11/19/19, 7:22:18 PM] Luc: Anyway, s√≠, pero lo gracioso es que anyways suena mas natural a mi oreja
[11/19/19, 7:22:33 PM] Luc: Creo que vi un post de tu Instagram
[11/19/19, 7:24:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Tiene que ver con esto
[11/19/19, 7:29:15 PM] Luc: Y cu√°les son las partes de Anita en las cuales se nota incertidumbre? O sea, right-brain?
[11/19/19, 8:17:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm todo lo que se me ocurre, tiene un dejo de left-brain jaja
[11/19/19, 8:33:20 PM] Luc: Talvez est√° por llegar el momento en lo cual descubr√≠s ese otro lado :)
[11/19/19, 8:53:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja es posible
[11/19/19, 9:16:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Te iba a decir de tomar algo, porque sal√≠ temprano. Pero creo que mi temprano no es tan temprano jaja.
[11/19/19, 9:18:47 PM] Luc: Me ibas a decir o me dec√≠s??
[11/19/19, 9:19:12 PM] Luc: Ya me pacte no tomar hasta el viernes
[11/19/19, 9:20:25 PM] Luc: üòü I'm sorry
[11/19/19, 9:21:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja te iba a decir y me acord√© que estoy en uniforme
[11/19/19, 9:22:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ni en tu poker night? No se si te creo eso.
[11/19/19, 9:22:32 PM] Luc: Hahaha no pasa nada el uniforme no me molesta
[11/19/19, 9:22:44 PM] Luc: No jugar√© esta semana
[11/19/19, 9:24:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ahhh okay, entonces puede que sea cierto
[11/19/19, 9:25:23 PM] Luc: Pero ten√©s raz√≥n que es dif√≠cil
[11/19/19, 9:25:35 PM] Luc: No me acostumbro a socializar sin que tomemos algo
[11/19/19, 9:27:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja
[11/19/19, 9:27:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: De verdad?
[11/19/19, 9:27:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si sirve de algo, ya vengo con dos cervezas encima. üòÖ
[11/19/19, 9:29:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Seguramente sea por eso que no me parece mala idea hacer algo un martes jaja)
[11/19/19, 9:30:40 PM] Luc: Hahaha mira vos
[11/19/19, 9:30:57 PM] Luc: Con amigos extranjeros siempre hay alcohol
[11/19/19, 9:31:11 PM] Luc: Con amigos argentinos no siempre pero depende m√°s la hora
[11/19/19, 9:31:30 PM] Luc: Y ya que nos encontramos siempre despu√©s del trabajo, hay vinito
[11/19/19, 9:35:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Claro
[11/19/19, 9:35:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Creo que a mi me pasa m√°s con comida que con bebidas
[11/19/19, 9:35:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Once a fatty, always a fatty ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/19/19, 9:37:47 PM] Luc: Hahahaha por favor
[11/19/19, 9:42:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es real jaja. Ya confes√© un mont√≥n hoy, una cosa m√°s no cambia nada. Fui varios a√±os a la nutricionista.
[11/19/19, 10:44:54 PM] Luc: A la nutricionista para poder adelgazar?
[11/19/19, 10:50:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yes sir
[11/19/19, 10:50:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Bah, para que me ense√±ara comer mejor, en verdad. Pero si, b√°sicamente si.
[11/19/19, 10:51:56 PM] Luc: Porque tuviste un problema espec√≠fico?
[11/19/19, 10:55:51 PM] Luc: S√© que ac√° es relativamente com√∫n
[11/19/19, 11:11:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nop. Pero com√≠a muy muy mal. Y as√≠ me ve√≠a.
[11/19/19, 11:12:59 PM] Luc: Bueno, probablemente no hace falta decirlo pero a m√≠ me pareces perfecta como sos
[11/19/19, 11:13:17 PM] Luc: O sea, mejorarte siempre es una meta deseable
[11/19/19, 11:14:02 PM] Luc: Pero no s√≠ significa que empez√°s pensando que ya no sos suficiente
[11/19/19, 11:14:06 PM] Luc: Espero que tenga sentido
[11/19/19, 11:19:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: S√≠, lo tiene.
[11/19/19, 11:19:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Y estoy muy de acuerdo
[11/19/19, 11:20:38 PM] Luc: D√≠a de tantas revelaciones
[11/19/19, 11:20:48 PM] Luc: üòõ
[11/19/19, 11:20:58 PM] Luc: Sigo ac√°
[11/19/19, 11:21:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajaja s√≠, estoy sorprendida!
[11/19/19, 11:21:44 PM] Luc: No seas mala! Hahaha
[11/19/19, 11:25:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me sorprendi√≥ que no hayas salido corriendo a√∫n.. eso quise decir jaja
[11/19/19, 11:25:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Igual te est√°s quedando atr√°s. Ya llegar√° el momento de las revelaciones de Luc, no?
[11/19/19, 11:28:34 PM] Luc: No s√© si hay mucho para revelar
[11/19/19, 11:28:43 PM] Luc: Soy un pibe bastante normal Ani

[11/19/19, 11:30:38 PM] Luc: Igual no quiero que te sientas que compart√≠as y yo no as√≠, si te queda alguna duda pregunt√°!
[11/19/19, 11:38:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: mmm creo que no
[11/19/19, 11:38:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: O al menos no ahora jaja

[11/19/19, 11:41:39 PM] Luc: Okay
[11/20/19, 12:08:56 AM] Luc: Even now that I can explain myself in English?
[11/20/19, 12:40:51 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha you are lucky that my couch keeps abducting me. I‚Äôm too sleepy to come up with any question
[11/20/19, 12:41:04 AM] Luc: No no you're fine
[11/20/19, 12:41:06 AM] Luc: Hahahah

[11/20/19, 8:15:19 AM] Luc: Hello, good morning :)
[11/20/19, 8:15:33 AM] Luc: No worries at all
[11/20/19, 8:19:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm not sure if I set my alarm wrong or if I turned it off completely asleep, but woke up late.
[11/20/19, 8:19:55 AM] Luc: This is late?
[11/20/19, 8:19:58 AM] Anita Zuddio: I really don‚Äôt like rushing in the morning
[11/20/19, 8:20:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha no. I‚Äôm already heading to the office
[11/20/19, 8:21:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: But I had to shower, breakfast and get ready in like.. 20 minutes
[11/20/19, 8:21:17 AM] Luc: Lightning fast
[11/20/19, 8:21:23 AM] Luc: I give myself a full hour
[11/20/19, 8:21:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: I probably still have the marks of the pillow in my face

[11/20/19, 12:12:41 PM] Luc: Already I've gotten a lot done
[11/20/19, 12:13:46 PM] Luc: How about yourself?
[11/20/19, 12:13:53 PM] Luc: Everything prepared for your trip next week?
[11/20/19, 12:53:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚ò∫
[11/20/19, 12:53:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm trying to make sure that most things are left paid
[11/20/19, 12:58:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: And I‚Äôm thinking that I should leave my bag ready between tonight and tomorrow.
[11/20/19, 1:02:23 PM] Luc: Always planning ahead üòõ
[11/20/19, 1:11:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hey! I‚Äôm trying to keep my Friday as unoccupied as possible.. üôÑ

[11/20/19, 9:01:11 PM] Luc: Hahaha don't worry at all
[11/20/19, 9:02:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: My train wouldn‚Äôt go to Retiro. So I walked all the way to the subte. Fell asleep and missed my station.
[11/20/19, 9:02:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Got here more than an hour late
[11/20/19, 9:02:35 PM] Luc: To congreso??
[11/20/19, 9:02:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly
[11/20/19, 9:02:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Woke up at 9 de Julio (two stops after mine)

[11/20/19, 9:03:30 PM] Luc: I'm sorry :(
[11/20/19, 9:04:04 PM] Luc: Glad you made it after all!
[11/20/19, 9:04:38 PM] Luc: I didn't end up having any meetings today after all, the schedule is so thrown off for this week
[11/20/19, 9:05:43 PM] Luc: I went to the gym, which in retrospect was silly given the heat today
[11/20/19, 9:07:18 PM] Luc: Then I decided to go to MALBA (amazing levels of AC) before I met up with a friend in Recoleta for drinks. And I ordered an agua con gas. Are you proud of me? #toosober
[11/20/19, 9:11:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha yeah, it probably was
[11/20/19, 9:11:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Why would you do that???

[11/20/19, 9:26:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: About that
[11/20/19, 9:28:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: I have no _requests_ at all for Friday.
[11/20/19, 9:29:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well, yes, you being there would be the only one.
[11/20/19, 9:39:05 PM] Luc: I'll have to pull some strings but I think I can make that happen
[11/20/19, 9:51:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/20/19, 9:52:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Great (:
[11/20/19, 9:53:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was gonna suggest some bar with a nice terrace. But it might rain. üò™
[11/20/19, 10:02:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Do you have any requests?
[11/20/19, 10:04:02 PM] Luc: I'll have to think about that one
[11/20/19, 10:04:42 PM] Luc: I'm sure we can come up with somewhere nice
[11/20/19, 10:09:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha please do

[11/20/19, 11:28:49 PM] Luc: Is okay
[11/20/19, 11:28:58 PM] Luc: I know you have had a crazy week
[11/20/19, 11:29:04 PM] Luc: But hey only two more days

[11/20/19, 11:30:55 PM] Luc: I'm good, I'm watching the debate! (The Democratic Debate in the USA)
[11/20/19, 11:32:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh no. I still have some final exams in December. But I‚Äôll be free of classes at least.
[11/20/19, 11:33:56 PM] Luc: Gonna feel weird and nostalgic?
[11/20/19, 11:44:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, probably. And relieved at the same time.
[11/20/19, 11:44:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/20/19, 11:47:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll probably won‚Äôt feel it until I pass those exams tho. But it‚Äôs just one more month. üôåüèº
[11/20/19, 11:47:56 PM] Luc: When are your exams exactly?
[11/20/19, 11:48:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: December 16, 18 and 19 (the big day).
[11/20/19, 11:49:33 PM] Luc: On the 19th you get covered in all types of gross things?
[11/20/19, 11:49:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Most probably
[11/20/19, 11:50:01 PM] Luc: Ah bummer
[11/20/19, 11:50:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: If I pass, that is
[11/20/19, 11:50:08 PM] Luc: I'll miss that
[11/20/19, 11:50:14 PM] Luc: You'll pass certainly
[11/20/19, 11:52:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: The only time I failed an exam was in one of the last ones of interpreting. Totally different circumstances, but I try not to keep my hopes to high anyway haha.
[11/20/19, 11:53:16 PM] Luc: Did some annoying foreign boy keep you up all night?
[11/20/19, 11:53:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh right. üò™ well, somebody will film it, most probably.
[11/20/19, 11:54:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I wish!
[11/20/19, 11:59:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I did get all those gross things after all..

[11/21/19, 12:02:19 AM] Luc: No s√© si entiendo
[11/21/19, 12:02:29 AM] Luc: Ya te recibiste de interpretaci√≥n
[11/21/19, 12:02:35 AM] Luc: Pero no de traducci√≥n?
[11/21/19, 12:03:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exacto. En mi universidad se dictan dos carreras: traducci√≥n publica e interpretaci√≥n.
[11/21/19, 12:03:14 AM] Luc: Ahhh
[11/21/19, 12:03:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yo me recib√≠ de int√©rprete. Y no hab√≠a muchas materias de diferencia, as√≠ que segu√≠ con la otra.

[11/21/19, 12:04:09 AM] Luc: La de tirar varias cosas
[11/21/19, 12:04:16 AM] Luc: Y despu√©s sacar fotos
[11/21/19, 12:04:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: Principalmente porque hay mucha m√°s salida laboral para el traductor publico. Y porque, de querer ser perito int√©rprete, necesito estar matriculada, y para eso necesito ser traductora p√∫blica. Una cosa llevo a la otra.
[11/21/19, 12:04:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja si
[11/21/19, 12:04:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: No se si tiene mucho sentido

[11/21/19, 10:56:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero decime si no te sentis bien ma√±ana.
[11/21/19, 10:58:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Prefiero que descanses y te recuperes, claramente.
[11/21/19, 11:01:08 PM] Luc: :) muy natural!
[11/21/19, 11:01:22 PM] Luc: Me voy a sentir bien

[11/21/19, 11:55:01 PM] Luc: Y _entre s√≠_
[11/21/19, 11:55:07 PM] Luc: Yo hab√≠a dicho
[11/21/19, 11:55:09 PM] Luc: A s√≠ mismo
[11/21/19, 11:55:13 PM] Luc: Porque me confund√≠

[11/22/19, 12:09:06 AM] Luc: Haha I joke I joke
[11/22/19, 12:09:10 AM] Luc: But really
[11/22/19, 12:09:43 AM] Anita Zuddio: Oh but you are right haha. Last summer I slept a few nights in the living room. Cause I couldn‚Äôt stand the heat.
[11/22/19, 12:10:03 AM] Luc: Moving on up
[11/22/19, 12:10:26 AM] Luc: And now, more working?
[11/22/19, 12:11:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm all out of energy. It will have to wait til tomorrow.
[11/22/19, 12:11:34 AM] Anita Zuddio: A quick shower, dinner and bed probably.
[11/22/19, 12:11:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: How about you?
[11/22/19, 12:11:53 AM] Luc: I'm beat but feeling pretty okay
[11/22/19, 12:12:01 AM] Luc: Food and a shower and such helped a lot
[11/22/19, 12:25:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: Why aren‚Äôt you in bed already?
[11/22/19, 12:25:45 AM] Luc: When am I everrrr in bed at 12:30 Ani?
[11/22/19, 12:30:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: Haha I know
[11/22/19, 12:30:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: I meant that you should try to get some rest. To feel better.
[11/22/19, 12:31:16 AM] Luc: I will i promise!
[11/22/19, 12:31:26 AM] Luc: What time tomorrow are you free?
[11/22/19, 12:34:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: Haha no need to promise
[11/22/19, 12:34:50 AM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm free and ready to go? Around 9.15/30.
[11/22/19, 12:34:54 AM] Anita Zuddio: Do you have any ideas?
[11/22/19, 12:35:08 AM] Luc: Late gurl
[11/22/19, 12:35:36 AM] Luc: I did but they were more afternoon vibes but actually
[11/22/19, 12:35:39 AM] Luc: It's easier
[11/22/19, 12:35:54 AM] Luc: To meet up for drinks and maybe some entertainment
[11/22/19, 12:46:52 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry üò™
[11/22/19, 12:47:05 AM] Luc: No no worry not
[11/22/19, 12:47:21 AM] Anita Zuddio: That sounds great
[11/22/19, 1:16:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll try to be ready as early as possible anyway, promise.
[11/22/19, 1:16:37 AM] Luc: Sure thing but
[11/22/19, 1:16:40 AM] Luc: Do your thing
[11/22/19, 1:16:47 AM] Luc: Dont rush
[11/22/19, 1:26:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt mind rushing when I really really wanna be at the destination. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/22/19, 1:27:27 AM] Luc: You have the world's sweetest chamuyito Anita üòò
[11/22/19, 1:28:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/22/19, 1:28:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: Chamuyito sounds awful
[11/22/19, 1:28:25 AM] Luc: Is there a better word?
[11/22/19, 1:28:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: (But it‚Äôs just the right word)
[11/22/19, 1:28:33 AM] Luc: I wrote it and it did sound wrong
[11/22/19, 1:28:40 AM] Luc: But I didn't know any other
[11/22/19, 1:29:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha it‚Äôs ok. It just sounded like it was a poor chamuyo.
[11/22/19, 1:29:32 AM] Luc: The opposite
[11/22/19, 1:32:50 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm trying to come up with a good place to go tomorrow, cause you are always the one with the good ideas.
[11/22/19, 1:39:20 AM] Luc: Always open to suggestions! But I think I've got some good ideas
[11/22/19, 2:02:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: You are amazing haha
[11/22/19, 2:03:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: Of course I fell asleep on my couch..
[11/22/19, 2:04:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sleep well üòò
[11/22/19, 11:55:54 AM] Luc: Heelloo
[11/22/19, 11:56:21 AM] Luc: Good morning (for five minutes more)!
[11/22/19, 12:04:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hey there!
[11/22/19, 12:04:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: How are you?
[11/22/19, 12:18:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: How are you feeling?
[11/22/19, 12:21:55 PM] Luc: I'm feeling good!
[11/22/19, 12:22:04 PM] Luc: How about yourself?
[11/22/19, 12:32:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm glad (:
[11/22/19, 12:51:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Good. Another day full of things to do at work, but at least the day is going pretty fast haha.
[11/22/19, 1:03:31 PM] Luc: Hahaha I feel you
[11/22/19, 1:03:39 PM] Luc: Well I'm really impressed
[11/22/19, 1:03:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: About?
[11/22/19, 1:04:19 PM] Luc: You?
[11/22/19, 1:04:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: Why? haha
[11/22/19, 1:04:45 PM] Luc: I don't know how you run on this level of sleep
[11/22/19, 1:05:01 PM] Luc: Slash activity
[11/22/19, 1:05:07 PM] Luc: It's impressive!
[11/22/19, 1:05:25 PM] Luc: Maybe some day I can introduce you to doing absolutely nothing for several hours
[11/22/19, 1:05:36 PM] Luc: Which is a beloved pasttime of mine once in a while
[11/22/19, 1:06:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs sounds sooo good
[11/22/19, 1:06:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: I set my mind on the fact that it was only one year.
[11/22/19, 1:08:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: I guess my obsessive personality helped.. most probably. But I‚Äôm quite happy that I made it.
[11/22/19, 1:08:30 PM] Luc: I have this group chat with my little step sisters
[11/22/19, 1:08:37 PM] Luc: And one of my actual sisters
[11/22/19, 1:08:42 PM] Luc: And it's hilarious
[11/22/19, 1:09:23 PM] Luc: It's just like non stop ridiculous conversation between them about anything from recipes to boys to the train system of Europe to Black Friday shopping
[11/22/19, 1:09:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: (You will have to explain why did you leave your other sister out of the group chat)
[11/22/19, 1:09:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Or she left... also a possibility
[11/22/19, 1:10:37 PM] Luc: Oh Anita
[11/22/19, 1:10:46 PM] Luc: I'll be happy to explain it to you tonight if you please
[11/22/19, 1:11:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yes, please
[11/22/19, 1:11:06 PM] Luc: But it's a looooong drama
[11/22/19, 1:11:11 PM] Luc: (el) drama
[11/22/19, 1:11:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajajaja
[11/22/19, 1:11:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Out loud
[11/22/19, 1:12:03 PM] Luc: My dad is basically a mute and just rather non-social
[11/22/19, 1:12:07 PM] Luc: So my family is 6 women
‚Äé[11/22/19, 1:12:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚ÄéGIF omitted
[11/22/19, 1:12:16 PM] Luc: Who are all incredibly different
[11/22/19, 1:12:25 PM] Luc: And me trying to smooth out their differences
[11/22/19, 1:12:39 PM] Luc: Leo üíò
[11/22/19, 1:13:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: That must be hard
[11/22/19, 1:13:48 PM] Luc: It's a full time job
[11/22/19, 1:14:13 PM] Luc: With very little remuneration
[11/22/19, 1:14:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ad honorem, I‚Äôd say.
[11/22/19, 1:14:43 PM] Luc: I don't know why I do it except that I love them and I prefer that they don't destroy eachother
[11/22/19, 1:16:25 PM] Luc: Just imagine Esperando La Carroza but every minute
[11/22/19, 1:16:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/22/19, 1:17:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Intense. Very intense.
[11/22/19, 1:19:17 PM] Luc: They are all so nice individually or in pairs I swear
[11/22/19, 1:19:32 PM] Luc: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[11/22/19, 1:24:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm highly looking forward to hearing the long drama. And any other story you may wanna share haha.
[11/22/19, 1:24:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Speaking of which..
[11/22/19, 1:25:38 PM] Luc: Such anticipation
[11/22/19, 1:26:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt had much time to think, I won‚Äôt lie. But I only came up with one nice bar. I mean, I know plenty, but none of them convinced me.
[11/22/19, 1:26:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hey! It‚Äôs Friday afternoon!
‚Äé[11/22/19, 1:27:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/22/19, 1:27:46 PM] Luc: Which one?
[11/22/19, 1:28:05 PM] Luc: I thought we could just go to Uptown since you hadn't been
[11/22/19, 1:28:08 PM] Luc: Have a drink there
[11/22/19, 1:28:20 PM] Luc: Then find a different bar that would be more tranqui
[11/22/19, 1:29:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Casa Babel. Have you been there?
[11/22/19, 1:30:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh but this sounds so much better.
[11/22/19, 1:30:23 PM] Luc: YES
[11/22/19, 1:30:28 PM] Luc: It's awesome

[11/22/19, 1:36:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: I loved that you described it as ‚Äúthe most Great Gatsby moment of your life‚Äù.
[11/22/19, 1:37:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Leo keeps coming up today)
[11/22/19, 1:44:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Need your help. How would you call those ‚Äúbooks‚Äù that you are given when you visit an exposition or a big event. With information, pictures, the name of the sponsors and stuff.
[11/22/19, 1:45:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: here it is called a ‚Äúprograma‚Äù
[11/22/19, 1:46:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I can‚Äôt find the right word in English, and it‚Äôs such a silly word ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/22/19, 2:03:02 PM] Luc: Depends on the type of event
[11/22/19, 2:03:25 PM] Luc: If you go to an opera or play or otherwise, it's a program or a "bill" (playbill)
[11/22/19, 2:03:41 PM] Luc: Otherwise you might just say informational booklet
[11/22/19, 2:03:56 PM] Luc: Which is a very general term which I think is very clearly understood
[11/22/19, 2:05:24 PM] Luc: Some other options, which may make more sense in context: flyer, roster, advertisement, poster, inventory, syllabus, bulletin, listing, catalogue, placard, card, handbill, schedule, agenda, handout, leaflet
[11/22/19, 2:05:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs the one
[11/22/19, 2:05:37 PM] Luc: yay, english!
[11/22/19, 2:05:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha you are the best thesaurus ever.

[11/22/19, 2:08:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Poor her!
[11/22/19, 2:13:45 PM] Luc: She's prone to this type of drama
[11/22/19, 2:19:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: It must be fun tho, I mean. She must surprise you with any sort of things haha.
[11/22/19, 2:20:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm really struggling with this translation. People write horribly. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/22/19, 2:44:34 PM] Luc: What's it about?
[11/22/19, 2:48:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs a newsletter about the things done by the organization last month.
[11/22/19, 2:49:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: But it is really hard to say something in good English when it is so awfully written in Spanish.  Some sentences don‚Äôt even make sense. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/22/19, 2:49:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: *about things done
[11/22/19, 2:50:34 PM] Luc: This is for habitat for humanity? I'm surprised that it's Spanish to English
[11/22/19, 2:51:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: H√°bitat Argrntina must send this newsletters to Habitat International.
[11/22/19, 2:51:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs why
[11/22/19, 2:51:37 PM] Luc: Aah
[11/22/19, 5:30:54 PM] Luc: Hello!
[11/22/19, 5:31:08 PM] Luc: I'm sorry I'm really bad at putting things together for tonight because I keep distracting myself
[11/22/19, 5:31:37 PM] Luc: Casa Babel is pretty cool but it's sort of far from anything else that I'm familiar with, so if it doesn't bother you I'd prefer if we chose another spot?
[11/22/19, 5:32:46 PM] Luc: Lemme know! I was thinking.. Hache, Trova, That Bar Which I Told You About But Never Named, and Uptown

[11/22/19, 6:52:31 PM] Luc: What. Ever!
[11/22/19, 6:54:27 PM] Luc: There's something therapeutic about putting on a very (for me un)boring economics podcast and cook in a very exacting manner
[11/22/19, 6:55:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm messing with you, it looks (and sounds) great.
[11/22/19, 6:56:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôd probably listen to something else. But just because I wouldn‚Äôt get a word of an economics podcast. üòÖ
[11/22/19, 6:56:27 PM] Luc: Very sleepable couch
[11/22/19, 6:59:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh it really isn‚Äôt haha.
[11/22/19, 6:59:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs just an optic illusion
[11/22/19, 7:33:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: So.. where shall we meet tonight?
[11/22/19, 7:34:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs not anxiety, it‚Äôs that I have to calculate how long it will take me to get there.
[11/22/19, 7:34:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÖ
[11/22/19, 7:34:37 PM] Luc: Corner offff arevalo and Nicaragua?

[11/22/19, 7:44:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: *happen
[11/22/19, 7:45:49 PM] Luc: No!! First, I consider you very punctual! Second, I don't mind at all, I know you're busy.
[11/22/19, 7:45:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: This is much closer to home. So I shouldn‚Äôt be that bad at calculating.
[11/22/19, 7:46:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: I made you wait two out of three dates. I really need to improve that.
[11/22/19, 7:50:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm now finishing the translation for habitat (I should have said no to this one ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ). I‚Äôll eat will I do this. Quick shower and I‚Äôm good to go. So I‚Äôll aim at 10. Let you know when I‚Äôm taking the bus (30 mins away). Is that ok?
[11/22/19, 7:50:25 PM] Luc: Perfect üòò

[11/24/19, 10:44:57 AM] Luc: It's only recently started honestly
[11/24/19, 10:45:04 AM] Luc: This place is really tranquil
[11/24/19, 10:45:12 AM] Luc: It's a little weird and sterile but nonetheless
[11/24/19, 10:50:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sterile?
[11/24/19, 10:51:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: What do you mean?
[11/24/19, 10:51:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: Like way too clean? haha
[11/24/19, 10:51:33 AM] Luc: In a more figurative sense
[11/24/19, 10:51:45 AM] Luc: Very american, to be honest
[11/24/19, 10:52:44 AM] Luc: I guess it's tough to explain
[11/24/19, 10:52:54 AM] Luc: Everything is brand new and the barrio is basically empty
[11/24/19, 10:53:34 AM] Luc: Part of me loves it cause it's nice and beautiful and part of me doesn't like it because it's so "non-Argentina" in my mind
[11/24/19, 10:57:58 AM] Anita Zuddio: I think I get it. My parent‚Äôs neighborhood is something like that. Although not that new by now.
[11/24/19, 11:05:12 AM] Luc: I totally _get_ it
[11/24/19, 11:05:45 AM] Luc: I'm just not sure if it's my vibe üòå

[11/24/19, 11:07:50 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yes! It was beautiful.
[11/24/19, 11:07:59 AM] Luc: Hahahaha s√≠?
[11/24/19, 11:08:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Until a bat passed really close to me and I got back inside.

[11/24/19, 1:17:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: I should do different trips I guess. Cause I would visit many different states that are far away from one another (almost said each other haha).

[11/24/19, 2:08:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: You‚Äôve spent your whole weekend so far socializing. I think you deserve some time for yourself haha.
[11/24/19, 2:10:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm having the chance to speed down this weekend. It feels sooo good.
[11/24/19, 2:12:07 PM] Luc: I'm needing that
[11/24/19, 2:12:13 PM] Luc: Time to look for plane tickets
[11/24/19, 2:15:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: That would be wise haha
[11/24/19, 2:20:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt wanna bother you while you cook/shower/nap, so let me know if I am. üòÖ
[11/24/19, 2:23:19 PM] Luc: You never bother me
[11/24/19, 2:23:27 PM] Luc: I'm just excited to get home
[11/24/19, 3:36:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòä
[11/24/19, 3:37:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: I fell asleep so deeply
[11/24/19, 3:51:48 PM] Luc: Nothing like an afternoon slumber
[11/24/19, 4:05:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Absolutely. It‚Äôs been a while since I last got to nap with no alarm.
[11/24/19, 8:09:05 PM] Luc: Hi there
[11/24/19, 8:09:21 PM] Luc: I slept like a baby
[11/24/19, 8:10:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hi! (:
[11/24/19, 8:11:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm glad
[11/24/19, 8:12:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: I guess you didn‚Äôt re-emerge after all haha
[11/24/19, 8:12:33 PM] Luc: No way in hell
[11/24/19, 8:16:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: You‚Äôll most definitely meet freckled Ani when I get back.
[11/24/19, 8:18:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Too much sun exposure and they explode haha.
[11/24/19, 8:24:24 PM] Luc: :))
[11/24/19, 8:24:35 PM] Luc: No tan just freckles? Or a bit of both
[11/24/19, 8:26:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: A bit of both
[11/24/19, 8:27:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: More freckles than tan for sure. I mean, my tan is any person‚Äôs no tan color. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/24/19, 8:29:21 PM] Luc: Hahahaha
[11/24/19, 8:29:25 PM] Luc: I get pretty dark
[11/24/19, 8:29:40 PM] Luc: But in general I try to avoid too much sun
[11/24/19, 8:30:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Show off haha
[11/24/19, 8:31:28 PM] Luc: I'm a brown person okay
[11/24/19, 8:31:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Wise of you
[11/24/19, 8:31:32 PM] Luc: We are like this
[11/24/19, 8:32:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Did you ever get badly sunburnt?
[11/24/19, 8:33:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: I suppose so, cause you told me that you spent a lot of time outdoors as a kid.. but who knows.
[11/24/19, 8:33:29 PM] Luc: I have been but it's rare
[11/24/19, 8:33:42 PM] Luc: I use sunscreen these days cause I'm not silly
[11/24/19, 8:35:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap, it‚Äôs really necessary
[11/24/19, 8:37:47 PM] Luc: I'm watching El marginal
[11/24/19, 8:37:50 PM] Luc: Thoughts?
[11/24/19, 8:39:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: That I should watch it in the near future.. haha
[11/24/19, 8:42:23 PM] Luc: What kinds of shows do you usually watch?
[11/24/19, 8:42:28 PM] Luc: If there's a genre you prefer
[11/24/19, 8:46:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: I really like crime shows. But I basically watch anything that catches my attention.
[11/24/19, 8:49:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: I have some pending right now, that I had to pause because of school. I already mentioned Criminal Minds and Suits last time. Also Billions, That 70‚Äôs Show (an oldie but I owed it to myself), and probably some others that I‚Äôm not remembering right now.
[11/24/19, 8:50:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: And a few documentaries pending as well.
[11/24/19, 8:50:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: How about you?
[11/24/19, 8:58:46 PM] Luc: You know I unfortunately don't have the attention span these days to watch a series beginning to end
[11/24/19, 8:58:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: When I finished high school, I had 12 series active simultaneously. It was impossible (and stupid) to try to keep up with all of them. After that I became really picky haha.
[11/24/19, 8:59:20 PM] Luc: I've basically seen the first episode of everything, the first season of many, and the whole series of very few
[11/24/19, 8:59:36 PM] Luc: I watched of course Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad
[11/24/19, 8:59:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha very well explained
[11/24/19, 8:59:55 PM] Luc: Though I prefer Breaking Bad because I prefer non-fantasy in general
[11/24/19, 9:00:12 PM] Luc: Plus the cinematography and acting is just incredible
[11/24/19, 9:00:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: We are going so great so far!
[11/24/19, 9:00:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Same
[11/24/19, 9:00:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Same
[11/24/19, 9:00:36 PM] Luc: I really like Black Mirror
[11/24/19, 9:00:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: So much same
[11/24/19, 9:00:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[11/24/19, 9:00:47 PM] Luc: Which I realize is fantasy but it appeals to me
[11/24/19, 9:01:12 PM] Luc: I loved Mad Men but I don't think I actually finished it. I must have seen 5 seasons though.
[11/24/19, 9:01:42 PM] Luc: House I saw all of, I loved it, used to watch it in high school, I can still watch it if it's on TV but it happens that as with most things I see repeatedly, I start to memorize
[11/24/19, 9:01:53 PM] Luc: So there's not much suspense left in it
[11/24/19, 9:02:38 PM] Luc: I love the Office and Parks and Recreation, I saw all of those
[11/24/19, 9:03:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Love it. But it‚Äôs fantasy totally based on reality. I mean, all fiction is at some level, but Black Mirror is much more close to it.
[11/24/19, 9:03:14 PM] Luc: And there were a few series like Westworld and Mr. Robot that I thought were really good but for some reason I haven't gone back to watch anything more than the first season
[11/24/19, 9:03:50 PM] Luc: I think I feel a little overwhelmed by choice like in many arenas of my life
[11/24/19, 9:04:06 PM] Luc: As well as watching a series is a time commitment that I don't usually think I can make
[11/24/19, 9:04:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Argentine furniture?
[11/24/19, 9:04:29 PM] Luc: Oh! The Wire. If you haven't seen it, you'll need to watch it. Amazing, amazing.
[11/24/19, 9:04:36 PM] Luc: ):
[11/24/19, 9:05:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ok. I didn‚Äôt mean to remind you about the sofa. Sorry about that.
[11/24/19, 9:05:52 PM] Luc: Hahah don't worry
[11/24/19, 9:06:01 PM] Luc: I just don't want to have to wake up tomorrow and start badgering people
[11/24/19, 9:06:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Same here, but I dropped it when he changed the original team, season 5 or sth like that. No reason whatsoever.
[11/24/19, 9:07:22 PM] Luc: I totally was going to but then I started to fall in love with 13 (olivia wilde)
[11/24/19, 9:08:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/24/19, 9:08:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Fair enough
[11/24/19, 9:12:15 PM] Luc: Well so far I like el marginal
[11/24/19, 9:12:20 PM] Luc: We'll see if I can stick with it
[11/24/19, 9:12:41 PM] Luc: I'm _usually_ better at watching series if I have someone to watch them with
[11/24/19, 9:13:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Some others I‚Äôve watched are Prison Break (the first.. two seasons were REALLY good). Friends, very big fan. Oh, Lie to me, I was so mad when they cancelled it. House of Cards, but I‚Äôm missing a few seasons. And I‚Äôm still missing some for sure.
[11/24/19, 9:13:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: They say it‚Äôs really good
[11/24/19, 9:14:28 PM] Luc: Oh prison break was great
[11/24/19, 9:14:34 PM] Luc: then it got all weird about like government conspiracy
[11/24/19, 9:14:59 PM] Luc: House of Cards was also super until the more recent seasons
[11/24/19, 9:15:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: I only did that with my mother. We watch Criminal Minds together since the very beginning. It‚Äôs harder since I moved out tho, but we try to do it anyway.
[11/24/19, 9:15:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly
[11/24/19, 9:16:39 PM] Luc: I watch Survivor, still (39 seasons on), mostly because my mother watches it
[11/24/19, 9:17:03 PM] Luc: And once you've invested that much of your life into a show, you sort of know everything and it makes it more entertaining
[11/24/19, 9:17:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha absolutely
[11/24/19, 9:19:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: How many episodes have you watched so far?
[11/24/19, 9:19:25 PM] Luc: Just the first!
[11/24/19, 9:20:22 PM] Luc: I was _going_ to say that if you're interested in watching it, Ms. Afternoons and Nights Free From Now On, we could watch it in sync
[11/24/19, 9:20:34 PM] Luc: But that's a lot of work
[11/24/19, 9:20:36 PM] Luc: hahah
[11/24/19, 9:22:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Why is that?
[11/24/19, 9:23:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: It sounds like a good plan. I‚Äôll just have to catch up with you when I come back.
[11/24/19, 9:23:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well yes, that might be a lot of work.
[11/24/19, 9:24:10 PM] Luc: Hahaha
[11/24/19, 9:24:13 PM] Luc: Now you understand the logistics
[11/24/19, 9:24:23 PM] Luc: I can wait as well
[11/24/19, 9:24:28 PM] Luc: I lived 27 years without El Marginal
[11/24/19, 9:24:34 PM] Luc: It's not like I can't live another week
[11/24/19, 9:27:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha don‚Äôt worry, I can perfectly catch up if you want someone to talk about it with.
[11/24/19, 9:27:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: That was horribly written, but you got me.
[11/24/19, 9:27:44 PM] Luc: okay!
[11/24/19, 9:27:54 PM] Luc: Well I might watch one more this week, but probably not because #laziness
[11/24/19, 9:34:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Haha
[11/24/19, 9:34:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Just let me know where you are
[11/24/19, 9:34:42 PM] Luc: Tomorrow is a big day for you
[11/24/19, 9:34:44 PM] Luc: Are you prepared?
[11/24/19, 9:35:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt think so haha
[11/24/19, 9:36:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll check the schedule while I eat
[11/24/19, 9:36:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm worried about.. everything.
[11/24/19, 9:39:57 PM] Luc: What do you do when you're stressed or worried to help relax?
[11/24/19, 9:49:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm that‚Äôs a good question
[11/24/19, 9:50:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: I guess I shower and get a coffee and something sweet.
[11/24/19, 9:50:17 PM] Luc: caffeine to reduce anxiety
[11/24/19, 9:50:19 PM] Luc: a bold strategy
[11/24/19, 9:50:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: And probably talk about it with sb (my cousin most of the times).
[11/24/19, 9:50:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[11/24/19, 9:51:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: You already know that I‚Äôm immune to caffeine.
[11/24/19, 9:51:46 PM] Luc: Not saying you need to but, do you ever go a few days without caffeine? What happens?
[11/24/19, 9:51:59 PM] Luc: I get headaches if I don't have caffeine for a few days
[11/24/19, 9:52:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I get headaches anyway
[11/24/19, 9:52:15 PM] Luc: and then eventually that will pass but I don't really like those 3-4 days where I feel totally tired and underwater
[11/24/19, 9:53:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm perfectly okay I guess. Probably because I drink many cups of coffee a day but I also have other infusions.
[11/24/19, 9:53:37 PM] Luc: _infusions_
[11/24/19, 9:53:44 PM] Luc: I like you
[11/24/19, 10:08:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/24/19, 10:09:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Was it wrong?
[11/24/19, 10:09:33 PM] Luc: Not at all
[11/24/19, 10:10:43 PM] Luc: It's a very fancy word that we're not really accustomed to using, at least in the states
[11/24/19, 10:11:12 PM] Luc: it draws a distinction that feels a bit unnecessary
[11/24/19, 10:12:24 PM] Luc: Sort of if I asked you how your bread was and you said to me, this is a great _baguette_
[11/24/19, 10:12:40 PM] Luc: I just told my dad that I'm gonna road trip with my friend
[11/24/19, 10:12:44 PM] Luc: and he's in full-indian dad mode
[11/24/19, 10:13:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Good to know! Thanks.
[11/24/19, 10:13:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: You‚Äôll have to explain me what you mean by that, clearly
‚Äé[11/24/19, 10:14:13 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/24/19, 10:14:28 PM] Luc: he'll keep going with these sort of "why you shouldn't do this" suggestions
[11/24/19, 10:14:41 PM] Luc: and I'll keep going telling him, okay, dad, thanks, okay, thanks again, okay
[11/24/19, 10:14:59 PM] Luc: until eventually I'll just be like jesus dad, i'm 27, leave me alone
[11/24/19, 10:15:30 PM] Luc: this is a very asian-dad aesthetic :D
[11/24/19, 10:15:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm aware of weather considerations‚Äù hahahaha
[11/24/19, 10:18:01 PM] Luc: we have a really good relationship honestly, i just don't have patience for these types of things
[11/24/19, 10:18:12 PM] Luc: My mom on the other hand
[11/24/19, 10:18:15 PM] Luc: Actually let's see
[11/24/19, 10:18:17 PM] Luc: Experiment time
[11/24/19, 10:19:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm so very intrigued.
[11/24/19, 10:20:14 PM] Luc: I never told you about my mini-joda?
[11/24/19, 10:20:27 PM] Luc: Where I would send my mom and dad the same message and screenshot their responses
[11/24/19, 10:20:38 PM] Luc: Just to keep an ongoing log of how different they are as humans
[11/24/19, 10:20:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: No, you didn‚Äôt.
[11/24/19, 10:21:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: But please do
‚Äé[11/24/19, 10:24:52 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
‚Äé[11/24/19, 10:24:52 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/24/19, 10:25:11 PM] Luc: Here's one simple example
[11/24/19, 10:25:45 PM] Luc: It's pithy but I think it's indicative of their very different attitudes
[11/24/19, 10:27:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I get it
[11/24/19, 10:28:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: I think I‚Äôd probably get similar responses from my parents anyway. But my dad would tell me to give it to him also, before the serious response.
[11/24/19, 10:29:55 PM] Luc: hahaha
[11/24/19, 10:29:59 PM] Luc: are tax returns a thing here?
[11/24/19, 10:30:46 PM] Luc: wait, anita,
[11/24/19, 10:30:48 PM] Luc: suma importancia
[11/24/19, 10:30:56 PM] Luc: i've found one of the world's best designed websites
[11/24/19, 10:30:59 PM] Luc: http://geocities.ws/lunfa2000/
[11/24/19, 10:31:08 PM] Luc: finally a resource to learn lunfardo
[11/24/19, 10:32:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm getting a headache and I think that the design of that website is making it worse
[11/24/19, 10:32:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÇ
[11/24/19, 10:32:27 PM] Luc: it's definitely not helping
[11/24/19, 10:32:33 PM] Luc: I just went back 20 years into the past
[11/24/19, 10:33:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: The moving title is everything
[11/24/19, 10:33:49 PM] Luc: hahahahaha yes
[11/24/19, 10:33:54 PM] Luc: the ticker
[11/24/19, 10:34:13 PM] Luc: the marquee we call it in web design
[11/24/19, 10:34:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh, like the theater, makes sense.
[11/24/19, 10:36:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was quite sure that ‚Äúmoving title‚Äù wasn‚Äôt the name, but I didn‚Äôt know the word to be honest.
[11/24/19, 10:36:41 PM] Luc: precisely
[11/24/19, 10:41:14 PM] Luc: It's a great site to be honest
[11/24/19, 10:41:22 PM] Luc: es un sitio _bien polenta_
[11/24/19, 10:42:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: I really need to check what expressions they are teaching you
[11/24/19, 10:42:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Otherwise you might end up talking like my grandparents did üòÇ
[11/24/19, 10:42:57 PM] Luc: The greatest generation
[11/24/19, 10:43:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Indeed
[11/24/19, 10:43:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Est√° ‚Äú√±oqui‚Äù
[11/24/19, 10:44:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: I already like it
[11/24/19, 10:44:58 PM] Luc: I used to make jokes about wanting to be a √±oqui primermundialista
[11/24/19, 10:45:08 PM] Luc: I don't think anyone ever understood the intent
[11/24/19, 10:45:52 PM] Luc: _caretear_
[11/24/19, 10:45:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/24/19, 10:45:59 PM] Luc: lo que se hace en Uptown?
[11/24/19, 10:46:03 PM] Luc: üôä
[11/24/19, 10:48:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Couldn‚Äôt have described it better
[11/24/19, 10:48:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[11/24/19, 10:49:53 PM] Luc: *discman.* m. Reproductor de discos compactos provisto de auriculares, que permite desplazarse al mismo tiempo que se escucha.
[11/24/19, 10:49:55 PM] Luc: 2005 ALERT
[11/24/19, 10:50:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha
[11/24/19, 10:50:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: I used to borrow it from my brothers.
[11/24/19, 10:51:12 PM] Luc: was it at least a sony?
[11/24/19, 10:51:53 PM] Luc: *musarela.* interj. lunf. usada para pedir a otra persona que guarde silencio sobre un tema. ("Vos, musarela"). || adj. lunf. Dicho de una persona: callada, en silencio. Se usa m√°s con el verbo quedar usado pronominalmente: "Se qued√≥ musarela".
[11/24/19, 10:51:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. Black.
[11/24/19, 10:51:57 PM] Luc: This is just good ^
[11/24/19, 10:52:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Please don‚Äôt
[11/24/19, 10:52:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha
[11/24/19, 10:53:16 PM] Luc: I can't help but commit these to memory
[11/24/19, 10:53:21 PM] Luc: They're superb
[11/24/19, 10:53:36 PM] Luc: I'm going to start translating them to english as well
[11/24/19, 10:53:43 PM] Luc: go home and interrupt my friends and say
[11/24/19, 10:53:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: That could be fun
[11/24/19, 10:54:03 PM] Luc: "Eric! Mozzarella."
[11/24/19, 10:54:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: You may accuse sb of being a gnocchi as well.
[11/24/19, 10:55:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Make it a thing there
[11/24/19, 10:55:26 PM] Luc: All italian-food-based insults

[11/24/19, 11:00:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Or at least not that I know.

[11/24/19, 11:03:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: And let‚Äôs pretend that I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúalready‚Äù so many times in one sentence.

[11/24/19, 11:09:00 PM] Luc: Bud√≠n I'm not sure is even common slang
[11/24/19, 11:09:06 PM] Luc: I've only heard it a few times but I like it
[11/24/19, 11:09:17 PM] Luc: I think it's supposed to be like a term of playful endearment

[11/25/19, 12:05:27 PM] Luc: Voy guardando citas mientras leo. Ac√° ten√©s una sola, la primera que guard√©. 

While other children of their age learned other things, Estha and Rahel learned how history negotiates its terms and collects its dues from those who break its laws. They heard it's sickening this. They smelled its smell and never forgot it. History's smell. Like old roses on a breeze. It would lurk for ever in ordinary things, in coat-hangers. Tomatoes. In the tar on the roads. In certain colours. In the plates at a restaurant. In the absence of words. And the emptiness in eyes.
[11/25/19, 12:05:44 PM] Luc: El de Roy, _The God of Small Things_
[11/25/19, 12:18:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Lo leo cuando est√© sentada y pueda poner atenci√≥n, promise.

[11/25/19, 2:29:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: No te sabr√≠a decir. Pero aparentemente vienen f√°cil. Debe ser porque es un clima bastante cercano al caribe√±o, caluroso y h√∫medo.

[11/26/19, 12:42:46 AM] Luc: I have no clue why but I remembered the show Homeland today and thought of you. If you haven't seen it, I think you'd like it. And it has your dear Mandy Patinkin in it :)
[11/26/19, 12:43:10 AM] Luc: Anyway I imagine you're completely exhausted and dead asleep. Hope you rest well! Good luck tomorrow.

[11/26/19, 12:56:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: I guess I‚Äôm not gonna enjoy it 100% because I try to be really careful with what I have to do (pay for things mostly).

[11/26/19, 12:56:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: And I‚Äôm constantly stressed about that.

[11/26/19, 12:58:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs the main reason why I‚Äôm here. And to keep an eye on the teachers, who take the trip as a holiday.

[11/26/19, 1:01:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: The driver of our van told me today that they will change our van (and driver) tomorrow. No heads up or anything.

[11/27/19, 12:19:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: Voy a pensar alternativas
[11/27/19, 12:20:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: Y me dispongo a dormir que ma√±ana nos toca un d√≠a muy largo.

[11/27/19, 3:12:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Entendes que hay gente que vive de catar los distintos tipos de yerba? Que estoy haciendo?!?!!
[11/27/19, 3:12:31 PM] Luc: Es una f√°brica que provee para varias marcas?
[11/27/19, 3:12:42 PM] Luc: O pertenece a una espec√≠fica?
[11/27/19, 3:12:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Son las plantaciones de Taragui. √ìsea: Taragui, uni√≥n, ma√±anita y La merced.
[11/27/19, 3:13:06 PM] Luc: Hahahaha entend√©s que hay gente que vive de catar aguas?
[11/27/19, 3:13:16 PM] Luc: Ahhhh
[11/27/19, 3:13:27 PM] Luc: No me gusta lo de taragui. üôä
[11/27/19, 3:13:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: El mate cocido si. La yerba maso.
[11/27/19, 3:14:11 PM] Luc: Nunca prob√©
[11/27/19, 3:14:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero me compr√© de La Merced que es la m√°s rica de todas las que tienen.
[11/27/19, 3:14:14 PM] Luc: Mate en saquitos
[11/27/19, 3:14:19 PM] Luc: Ni caf√© en saquito

[11/27/19, 10:01:46 PM] Luc: Que bueno
[11/27/19, 10:02:05 PM] Luc: Ya paso la mitad de la semana
[11/27/19, 10:02:08 PM] Luc: Est√°s por volver
[11/27/19, 10:02:13 PM] Luc: Como te sent√≠s?
[11/27/19, 10:14:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Creo que quiero volver porque no quiero que me pique m√°s nada.
[11/27/19, 10:14:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Y porque me estoy encari√±ando con algunos, a m√°s tiempo m√°s dif√≠cil va a ser la despedida.
[11/27/19, 10:27:01 PM] Luc: Aww
[11/27/19, 10:27:11 PM] Luc: Tierna
[11/27/19, 11:20:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Flojita
[11/27/19, 11:20:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajaja
[11/27/19, 11:21:17 PM] Luc: Holi
[11/27/19, 11:22:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Qu√© tal tu noche?
[11/27/19, 11:23:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ac√° estoy necesitando MUCHO una ducha y la cama.
[11/27/19, 11:24:19 PM] Luc: Mas picaduras?
[11/27/19, 11:24:49 PM] Luc: A cremarte! (Lol)
[11/27/19, 11:25:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: Despu√©s de la ducha, sin dudas!
[11/27/19, 11:26:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòì
[11/27/19, 11:26:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Anoche no me pod√≠a dormir de la picaz√≥n.
[11/27/19, 11:26:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero lo dec√≠a por cansancio m√°s que nada. Fue un d√≠a largo. Todav√≠a no llegamos al hotel.
[11/27/19, 11:27:08 PM] Luc: Pero es mas dif√≠cil prender fuego a un cuerpo mojado ü§î
[11/27/19, 11:27:11 PM] Luc: Yikes
[11/27/19, 11:27:34 PM] Luc: No s√© c√≥mo se hace con pibes de 12/13 a√±os
[11/27/19, 11:27:40 PM] Luc: Durante 15 horas
[11/27/19, 11:28:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pens√© que lo dec√≠as por crema, no por fuego. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ jajaja
[11/27/19, 11:28:33 PM] Luc: Se puede decir para las dos cosas?
[11/27/19, 11:28:45 PM] Luc: Si lo dije por crema pero me gust√≥ el doble sentido
[11/27/19, 11:29:00 PM] Luc: Ya que hoy decidimos que te sacrificamos
[11/27/19, 11:29:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ser√≠a encremar para la crema, pero same shit
[11/27/19, 11:29:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajajaja
[11/27/19, 11:29:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: Cierto
[11/27/19, 11:37:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hubo avances con los planes que estaban haciendo para el viernes con tus amigos?
[11/27/19, 11:38:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Mis intenciones son m√°s que obvias, ni lo explico)
[11/27/19, 11:38:14 PM] Luc: Se desarmaron los tuyos?
[11/27/19, 11:38:39 PM] Luc: Tengo un audio esperandome que no quiero escuchar hasta la ma√±ana
[11/27/19, 11:47:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Viernes no tengo tal cosa
[11/27/19, 11:47:18 PM] Luc: Nada?
[11/27/19, 11:47:43 PM] Luc: Ya se me complica üòî
[11/27/19, 11:47:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja demasiado largo?
[11/27/19, 11:48:07 PM] Luc: No pero requiere respuesta por supuesto
[11/27/19, 11:48:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: No hay drama. Era s√≥lo si no se hab√≠an concretado, olv√≠date.
[11/27/19, 11:48:22 PM] Luc: Y nada. Tarea para luc del futuro
[11/27/19, 11:49:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja por qu√© hacer hoy lo que podes dejar para ma√±ana.
[11/27/19, 11:49:24 PM] Luc: Palabras to live by
[11/27/19, 11:51:01 PM] Luc: Te voy avisando pero es probable que no me disponga
[11/27/19, 11:53:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: No worries
[11/27/19, 11:55:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Era solo porque falta mucho para el domingo.
[11/27/19, 11:59:12 PM] Luc: :( si pero
[11/27/19, 11:59:15 PM] Luc: Ma√±ana Thanksgiving
[11/27/19, 11:59:29 PM] Luc: Van a comer pavo?
[11/28/19, 12:03:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm no creo
[11/28/19, 12:03:51 AM] Anita Zuddio: Vos vas a cocinar al final?
[11/28/19, 12:03:58 AM] Luc: Nope
[11/28/19, 12:04:14 AM] Luc: Gonna try to have a pretty chill day tomorrow actually
[11/28/19, 12:05:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sounds like a great plan
[11/28/19, 12:05:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: (I didn‚Äôt realize it was Thursday already, my bad)
[11/28/19, 12:06:10 AM] Luc: I can never forgive you
[11/28/19, 12:06:17 AM] Luc: You crossed the line
[11/28/19, 12:07:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: I know üò™ (literally, the 00.00 line)
[11/28/19, 12:07:55 AM] Anita Zuddio: One new reason to sacrifice me to the gods haha
[11/28/19, 12:10:33 AM] Luc: List of reasons to sacrifice Anita 
1. Crossed the line 
End of list
[11/28/19, 12:12:01 AM] Luc: I know you're a fan of lists üòò
[11/28/19, 12:12:17 AM] Luc: And I'm a fan of silly humor like making lists with one entry and writing end of list
[11/28/19, 12:12:34 AM] Luc: It's all very wes anderson to me
[11/28/19, 12:13:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/28/19, 12:14:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: I really need to improve the image you have of me
[11/28/19, 12:19:30 AM] Luc: Is it inaccurate?
[11/28/19, 12:31:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not one bit
[11/28/19, 12:33:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: But I don‚Äôt want you to see me _only_ as this obsessive woman who loves lists. Or you‚Äôll run away way too soon and with good reason haha.
[11/28/19, 12:36:24 AM] Luc: I don't see you that way, I promise
[11/28/19, 12:52:21 AM] Anita Zuddio: Good üòÖ
[11/28/19, 12:54:34 AM] Luc: Showered and feeling better?

[11/28/19, 12:55:34 AM] Anita Zuddio: Oh yes
[11/28/19, 12:57:15 AM] Luc: Encremada
[11/28/19, 1:22:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yes! And I‚Äôve just finished the accounting of the day.
[11/28/19, 1:22:48 AM] Luc: Down to the last peso
[11/28/19, 1:23:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: That doesn‚Äôt sound ok. But it‚Äôs too late for proper writing haha.
[11/28/19, 1:23:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. Only half a day to go.
[11/28/19, 1:23:47 AM] Luc: They release you tomorrow?
[11/28/19, 1:24:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yes, I leave the kids at the school tomorrow afternoon and I head back to the estancia. Until Friday morning that I take the flight back.
[11/28/19, 1:25:10 AM] Luc: And do you get Friday off at least once you're back?
[11/28/19, 1:25:15 AM] Luc: Or do you go to the office and such
[11/28/19, 1:26:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: I get the Friday off, unless they tell me otherwise.
[11/28/19, 1:26:29 AM] Luc: Tenuous
[11/28/19, 1:28:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll check tomorrow with my boss. But I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll ask me to go. My bosses are away so the office is pretty calm these days.
[11/28/19, 1:28:15 AM] Luc: Nice :)
[11/28/19, 1:28:26 AM] Luc: Well I'm not really required to work
[11/28/19, 1:29:02 AM] Luc: And I don't think I'm required (by social contract) to be anywhere until like, 7pm at the earliest
[11/28/19, 1:32:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: Great (:
[11/28/19, 1:33:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: My mom‚Äôs picking me up by the airport. So I‚Äôll probably have lunch with her. But then I should be free until 7 (pilates).
[11/28/19, 1:35:11 AM] Luc: Maybe se arma algo
[11/28/19, 1:35:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/28/19, 1:36:21 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôd really like that. Whatever _algo_ may be.
[11/28/19, 1:37:37 AM] Luc: What time does lunch end(ish)?
[11/28/19, 1:38:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: Around 2 I guess.
[11/28/19, 1:39:10 AM] Luc: good good
[11/28/19, 1:39:16 AM] Luc: okay!
[11/28/19, 1:39:33 AM] Luc: let's tentatively say yes to an undefined outing
[11/28/19, 1:39:50 AM] Luc: and let me sleep on it and see if i get the necessary inspiration to make it not undefined
[11/28/19, 1:40:40 AM] Luc: does that sound fair?
[11/28/19, 1:40:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/28/19, 1:40:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: More than fair
[11/28/19, 1:41:11 AM] Luc: let me be more clear, i want to see you, i just don't want to think about the when and where at this moment hahaha
[11/28/19, 1:41:24 AM] Luc: you can tell i'm avoiding doing any more "work" for the day
[11/28/19, 1:41:59 AM] Luc: which is something i have to force myself to do since I work at home mostly, I have to set a time to be productive and time to be a potato otherwise all my hours sort of end up half-productive and i'm never fully focused or fully relaxed :)
[11/28/19, 1:41:50 AM] Anita Zuddio: You deserve it
[11/28/19, 1:42:54 AM] Anita Zuddio: That makes a lot of sense (and it‚Äôs so very admirable).
[11/28/19, 1:43:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll let you rest
[11/28/19, 1:43:24 AM] Luc: It's admirable but I don't stick to it
[11/28/19, 1:43:37 AM] Luc: on the 28th of every month (cause february) I do all my finances stuff
[11/28/19, 1:43:46 AM] Luc: and it's barely the 28th and I'm doing it now
[11/28/19, 1:44:20 AM] Luc: but at least it's not creative work
[11/28/19, 1:44:22 AM] Luc: it's just like
[11/28/19, 1:44:31 AM] Luc: copying and pasting and adding and a few percentages
[11/28/19, 1:45:55 AM] Anita Zuddio: Wait, I didn‚Äôt get it. You are doing it the very day you usually do it.
[11/28/19, 1:46:18 AM] Luc: yeah but i mean
[11/28/19, 1:46:22 AM] Luc: i can't even wait until morning
[11/28/19, 1:46:24 AM] Luc: hahah
[11/28/19, 1:46:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ohhh
[11/28/19, 1:46:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/28/19, 1:46:45 AM] Anita Zuddio: Got it
[11/28/19, 1:47:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs fine. I guess I would (try to) do exactly the same if I worked from home.
[11/28/19, 1:48:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: Do your thing, we talk tomorrow (later today).
[11/28/19, 1:48:38 AM] Luc: This is your clever way of telling me you're falling asleep
[11/28/19, 1:48:46 AM] Luc: And I'm fine with that, sleep girl
[11/28/19, 1:48:56 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll try to think of sth for Friday afternoon as well.
[11/28/19, 1:49:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly. I needed to renew my speech haha.
[11/28/19, 1:50:15 AM] Luc: No worries
[11/28/19, 1:50:21 AM] Luc: Enjoy your last half-day with the pibitos
[11/28/19, 1:50:36 AM] Luc: And take some well-deserved rest tomorrow night
[11/28/19, 1:51:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: Is this your clever way of telling me that you are gonna be busy tomorrow? haha
[11/28/19, 1:51:57 AM] Anita Zuddio: Thanks! Will do.
[11/28/19, 1:52:10 AM] Luc: Not at all!
[11/28/19, 1:52:09 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sleep well üòò
[11/28/19, 1:52:22 AM] Luc: This is my sweet way of telling you I'm impressed by you
[11/28/19, 1:52:33 AM] Luc: Night! üòò
[11/28/19, 2:02:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs sweet indeed. üòä
[11/28/19, 2:02:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm going to bed smiling hard. Thanks for that.
[11/28/19, 2:02:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: üòò
[11/28/19, 2:02:58 AM] Luc: I'm glad :)
[11/28/19, 2:03:01 AM] Luc: Sleep well!
‚Äé[11/28/19, 8:17:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/28/19, 8:17:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: Morning! (:
[11/28/19, 9:46:53 AM] Luc: Morning!
[11/28/19, 9:47:05 AM] Luc: Hahaha
[11/28/19, 9:47:15 AM] Luc: I still prefer the sticker
[11/28/19, 9:48:55 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, it‚Äôs really good
[11/28/19, 9:50:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: We are heading to Corrientes now. But there was a manifestation at the plaza in front of our hotel. As soon as we left they began throwing stones at the police. We are hearing it on the radio. üò∞
[11/28/19, 9:51:16 AM] Luc: Protest
[11/28/19, 9:51:26 AM] Luc: Muy Boca/River
‚Äé[11/28/19, 9:51:47 AM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/28/19, 9:51:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: You are right
[11/28/19, 9:52:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: Berni. Love it. The expressions.
[11/28/19, 9:52:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Apparently I forgot how to write complete sentences
[11/28/19, 9:52:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/28/19, 9:53:19 AM] Luc: This is, in my humble opinion, the best work of Argentine art, period
[11/28/19, 9:55:39 AM] Anita Zuddio: It probably is.
[11/28/19, 9:56:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: Only a few months ago, when I visited MALBA to see Erlich‚Äôs exposition, did I realize that it is not called Pan y trabajo.
[11/28/19, 9:56:34 AM] Anita Zuddio: Years saying it wrong
[11/28/19, 9:58:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: We are switching buses again soon and I don‚Äôt want to. I like this driver better haha.
[11/28/19, 10:25:37 AM] Luc: I can sit in front of it forever, I love this period of Berni's work
[11/28/19, 10:40:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: He is definitely one of the bests, if not the best. I have this book with his works at my parent‚Äôs home.. the way he portrays the life in the villas is incredible (and so very sad). The Juanito Laguna series gives me goosebumps.
‚Äé[11/28/19, 10:40:40 AM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/28/19, 10:41:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm no, I‚Äôll send you a photo.. if I don‚Äôt forget haha.
[11/28/19, 10:41:58 AM] Luc: Ah well this one is great too
[11/28/19, 10:42:30 AM] Luc: Not sure how your book is but this has quite a lot of information about his life and inspiration and evolution and such, not just pictures of his obras
[11/28/19, 10:45:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pretty much the same.
[11/28/19, 10:45:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: (Love the clock btw)
[11/28/19, 10:50:35 AM] Luc: Thanks :)
[11/28/19, 10:51:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: Those books are the best. To help understand what they were trying to say/show.
[11/28/19, 10:52:25 AM] Luc: Yeah you notice that it all sort of tends towards the same end though
[11/28/19, 10:54:05 AM] Luc: ie. artist starts out documenting injustice, artist evolves their style, artist becomes more abstract and more disillusioned, artist begins to associate injustice with systemic failure and becomes a critic of X, artist dies and finally gets recognition
[11/28/19, 10:55:59 AM] Luc: in Berni's case it was basically that he moved to NY and started to see capitalism as having caused the great ills of the world
[11/28/19, 10:58:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Couldn‚Äôt have explained it better
[11/28/19, 10:59:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: And you can add madness as a factor for some.
[11/28/19, 11:00:00 AM] Luc: this is an oversimplification. cause he had already done the whole ramona series and juanito etc.
[11/28/19, 11:00:35 AM] Luc: but you get my point I guess
[11/28/19, 11:01:22 AM] Anita Zuddio: Insanity? You got me. Some of my favorites have that in common haha. Goya, Van Gogh, just to name some.
[11/28/19, 11:01:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: I do
[11/28/19, 11:03:11 AM] Luc: Oh Goya is just too good. I spent an entire day in the Prado (which is a fucking fortress) in September
[11/28/19, 11:03:46 AM] Luc: I guess that helps explain why the MNBA doesn't do much for me
[11/28/19, 11:05:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Oh yes! What a great museum!
[11/28/19, 11:07:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: My favorite painting of him is there. I stood in front of it forever.
[11/28/19, 11:08:23 AM] Luc: Saturn?
[11/28/19, 11:08:39 AM] Anita Zuddio: Fun (not so fun) fact. I got my pencil case there. The most beautiful ever. Got robbed at the Paseo del Prado üò≠. And walked all the way back to buy it once again.
[11/28/19, 11:09:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: The Third of May 1808
[11/28/19, 11:09:21 AM] Luc: Robbed how, what?
[11/28/19, 11:09:44 AM] Luc: surprising
[11/28/19, 11:10:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: The scene is horrible. But everything, from the light to the expressions, is just amazing.
[11/28/19, 11:10:46 AM] Luc: I remember it
[11/28/19, 11:11:06 AM] Luc: it's like if you took an average of the black series and then mixed it with all the other battle scenes in the museum
[11/28/19, 11:13:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: I usually wear my backpack to the front when turisting. But for some reason I didn‚Äôt that day. I got distracted just for a few minutes, wandering around with my family.. and they opened it and took as much as they could without me noticing. When I did, sb handed me back a hat, as if I had left it open.
[11/28/19, 11:14:17 AM] Luc: Ah gotcha
[11/28/19, 11:14:23 AM] Luc: So no gunpoint stickup, that's good at least
[11/28/19, 11:14:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: When I checked, my shopping bags from the museum were missing and the case of my camera (empty).
[11/28/19, 11:14:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: No, should have said pickpocketing probably.
[11/28/19, 11:15:43 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly!
[11/28/19, 11:15:54 AM] Anita Zuddio: His engravings are the other part of his work that absolutely blows my mind.
[11/28/19, 11:20:15 AM] Luc: I don't know if I'm familiar
[11/28/19, 11:20:31 AM] Luc: I don't know why I say ambiguous things like that
[11/28/19, 11:20:34 AM] Luc: I'm not familiar*
[11/28/19, 12:04:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajajaja
[11/28/19, 12:06:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: They‚Äôve brought them to Museo Larreta more than once. Let you know if I find out they do again. (:
[11/28/19, 12:06:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: (If you like the idea, that is)
[11/28/19, 12:07:57 PM] Luc: I love the idea
[11/28/19, 12:08:12 PM] Luc: Though I can't imagine such incredible works in such a lackluster museum
[11/28/19, 12:08:17 PM] Luc: I honestly hate that museum
[11/28/19, 12:08:24 PM] Luc: If not for the garden I would never go
[11/28/19, 12:08:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was going to say that precisely. The garden is nice.
[11/28/19, 12:09:04 PM] Luc: Last time I went it was like an exhibition about how 16th century women dressed
[11/28/19, 12:09:08 PM] Luc: Huge yawn
[11/28/19, 12:09:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/28/19, 12:10:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: It doesn‚Äôt sound like the most appealing exhibition..
[11/28/19, 12:34:13 PM] Luc: So when we see eachother on Sunday
[11/28/19, 12:34:28 PM] Luc: I'll be celebrating 888 days since I moved to Argentina
[11/28/19, 12:35:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt expect that at all haha
[11/28/19, 12:36:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: What shall we do?
[11/28/19, 12:36:24 PM] Luc: la vida se evapora
[11/28/19, 12:36:35 PM] Luc: condense?
[11/28/19, 12:37:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: What do you mean?
[11/28/19, 12:37:33 PM] Luc: if life is evaporating every day, then certainly the only to combat that is to condense
[11/28/19, 12:37:45 PM] Luc: like tiny droplets on a surface
[11/28/19, 12:38:03 PM] Luc: jueves de profound thoughts lol
[11/28/19, 12:38:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/28/19, 12:38:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: I hadn‚Äôt got it
[11/28/19, 12:40:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: We can meet for a little bit less than 15 minutes.. 14.8 would be 888 seconds.
[11/28/19, 12:40:58 PM] Luc: why not 14.8 hours?
[11/28/19, 12:41:01 PM] Luc: I guess you don't like me that much
[11/28/19, 12:41:07 PM] Luc: üíî
[11/28/19, 12:41:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I though it the other way around
[11/28/19, 12:41:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: You wouldn‚Äôt stand 14.8 hours of me.
[11/28/19, 12:42:15 PM] Luc: Try me
[11/28/19, 12:44:12 PM] Luc: Can I tell you something that makes me happier than it should?
[11/28/19, 12:44:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Careful with what you ask.
[11/28/19, 12:44:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[11/28/19, 12:44:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sure
[11/28/19, 12:46:24 PM] Luc: I have 300Mbps internet at home and it costs me US$30 a month
[11/28/19, 12:46:52 PM] Luc: And sometimes this thing happens, I haven't figured out why yet
[11/28/19, 12:47:04 PM] Luc: Where it gets unthrottled and I get the full speed of the network
‚Äé[11/28/19, 12:47:06 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/28/19, 12:47:19 PM] Luc: I wanted to watch last night's episode of survivor so when I talk to my mom later we can discuss it
[11/28/19, 12:47:33 PM] Luc: and I downloaded a 2GB file in 48 seconds
[11/28/19, 12:47:42 PM] Luc: You understand the full extent of my inner nerd
[11/28/19, 12:48:09 PM] Luc: But slow internet is probably my biggest pet peeve. Because there's no reason for it except greed and shitty infrastructure, both of which are problems we know how to solve
[11/28/19, 12:47:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/28/19, 12:49:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: I think I do hahaha
[11/28/19, 12:49:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: You are absolutely right
[11/28/19, 12:51:59 PM] Luc: Anyway to pay for internet this fast in the USA would cost upwards of $200 a month depending where you are, and you'd have to deal with Comcast which is actually _worse_ than Fibertel
[11/28/19, 12:52:48 PM] Luc: Which to me is just laughable, when things work vastly better here than there I'm reminded that the concept of first/second/third world is an illusion we've invented to describe bad sanitation and infrastructure
[11/28/19, 12:55:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, it probably was like that decades ago. But I think it should be redefined.
[11/28/19, 12:56:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Random comment. I don‚Äôt have to go to the office tomorrow afternoon.
[11/28/19, 1:07:06 PM] Luc: Within the field of economics we've already sunsetted those terms
[11/28/19, 1:07:22 PM] Luc: It's now underdeveloped/developing/developed
[11/28/19, 1:07:41 PM] Luc: Which I think works nicely given that the field of study is called development economics
[11/28/19, 1:08:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: God, I‚Äôm such a grammar freak. I loved that you used sunset as a verb.
[11/28/19, 1:08:08 PM] Luc: The day has arrived for me to trudge down to Calle Florida and do illegal things
[11/28/19, 1:08:29 PM] Luc: This is a common practice in software development
[11/28/19, 1:08:36 PM] Luc: Products and features get sunsetted
[11/28/19, 1:08:53 PM] Luc: Because you see them go slowly and it's a beautiful death
[11/28/19, 1:09:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Right. I did know that.
[11/28/19, 1:10:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs perfect.
[11/28/19, 1:20:21 PM] Luc: thanks for this beto, reallya
[11/28/19, 1:20:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm missing something
[11/28/19, 1:20:58 PM] Luc: the only way to feel better in the face of this kind of annoying shit is to yell FUCK very loudly in the privacy of my own home
[11/28/19, 1:21:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh. This!
[11/28/19, 1:21:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/28/19, 1:24:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: I know you are.. but be careful.
[11/28/19, 1:25:41 PM] Luc: I put on my most hoodrat clothes
[11/28/19, 1:25:46 PM] Luc: and I have yet to shower today
[11/28/19, 1:25:48 PM] Luc: playing the part1
[11/28/19, 1:27:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I‚Äôd pay to see that
[11/28/19, 1:32:05 PM] Luc: Hip hop Luc?
[11/28/19, 1:32:16 PM] Luc: It's how I dress on the days I don't see you sooooo
[11/28/19, 1:32:24 PM] Luc: Just bein the pibe I am
[11/28/19, 1:34:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Nooooo
[11/28/19, 1:34:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: I want to meet that Luc!
[11/28/19, 1:34:51 PM] Luc: Ha
[11/28/19, 1:35:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: (We all have that version)
[11/28/19, 1:43:08 PM] Luc: I struggle to envision hoodrat Anita
[11/28/19, 1:43:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[11/28/19, 1:45:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sweatpants Anita is very much a thing.
[11/28/19, 2:07:56 PM] Luc: I play a game on the subte called _Everything is on Fire_
[11/28/19, 2:08:03 PM] Luc: Can you guess what this game consists of?
[11/28/19, 2:11:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahahaha
[11/28/19, 2:11:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not touching a thing?
[11/28/19, 2:13:09 PM] Luc: Pretty much that
[11/28/19, 2:13:20 PM] Luc: And lots of intense eye contact with other passengers
[11/28/19, 2:13:52 PM] Luc: I feel public transportation is underrated as a way to silently bond as humans
[11/28/19, 2:14:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: A little bit creepy
[11/28/19, 2:14:32 PM] Luc: I smile too
[11/28/19, 2:14:37 PM] Luc: More creepy or less?
[11/28/19, 2:14:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: More
[11/28/19, 2:14:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Definitely more
[11/28/19, 2:15:01 PM] Luc: You just don't _get_ me ani
[11/28/19, 2:23:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: I mean, I would enjoy it. You, smiling and making eye contact. But I don‚Äôt know if an old lady peacefully heading home would.

[11/28/19, 2:39:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Excellent
[11/28/19, 2:41:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: Quick stop at Falabella?
[11/28/19, 2:45:17 PM] Luc: Always
[11/28/19, 2:45:27 PM] Luc: GET the chorros off my tail
[11/28/19, 2:45:35 PM] Luc: The deed is done
[11/28/19, 2:45:55 PM] Luc: I would have liked to change 900 but that actually scares me so I just changed 300
[11/28/19, 2:46:02 PM] Luc: At 67 üôåüèº
[11/28/19, 2:58:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Wise. Very wise.
[11/28/19, 2:58:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Awesome!
[11/28/19, 3:00:24 PM] Luc: So as of the most recent statistics
[11/28/19, 3:00:38 PM] Luc: The GDP per capita of Argentina is about $14,400
[11/28/19, 3:00:46 PM] Luc: Essentially exactly $1,200 a month
[11/28/19, 3:01:17 PM] Luc: Which would be 72.000 ARS
[11/28/19, 3:01:30 PM] Luc: Doesn't that seem a little bit crazy as the promedio de salario?
[11/28/19, 3:01:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/28/19, 3:01:51 PM] Luc: Means simply that the data has a long right tail
[11/28/19, 3:02:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: Absolutely
‚Äé[11/28/19, 3:02:33 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/28/19, 3:02:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Laughing not to cry.
[11/28/19, 3:03:18 PM] Luc: If that's the case what does setting a $200 limit on the purchase of dollars actually accomplish?
[11/28/19, 3:03:24 PM] Luc: Well
[11/28/19, 3:03:38 PM] Luc: It doesn't accomplish it's stated goal to limit or slow capital flight
[11/28/19, 3:03:54 PM] Luc: Because the black market springs to life overnight and there is zero enforcement
[11/28/19, 3:03:59 PM] Luc: It's just an open secret
[11/28/19, 3:05:06 PM] Luc: If you're struggling and you can't afford to save more than $200 a month, it's zero problem, your life is the same before and after (well there are other distortions but we can throw those out for the sake of simplicity)
[11/28/19, 3:05:58 PM] Luc: If you're welathy and you can afford to save well over $200 a month, it also makes little difference. It makes it _slightly_ more expensive to purchase dollars, but it doesn't actually stop anyone.
[11/28/19, 3:06:56 PM] Luc: So what's left? The middle class. Those who can save maybe $200, maybe a bit more, maybe it's their birthday and they get some money from their parents, whatever the situation may be
[11/28/19, 3:07:16 PM] Luc: It effectively lowers their ability to combat inflation by saving in stable currency
[11/28/19, 3:07:27 PM] Luc: So you end up with this system that you see all over the country
[11/28/19, 3:07:48 PM] Luc: Where the middle class consistently gets fucked
[11/28/19, 3:07:53 PM] Luc: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[11/28/19, 3:08:18 PM] Luc: And the more the government does to manipulate prices and the money supply the more this effect is exacerbated
[11/28/19, 3:09:27 PM] Luc: So generally it's just a shitty time to be a hard-working honest person. And this reaffirms my belief that people are inherently good and inherently the same everywhere, but that they absolutely respond to incentives
[11/28/19, 3:10:11 PM] Luc: Okay I'm done! Taxi thoughts.
[11/28/19, 3:10:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: I can‚Äôt add anything. Because I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to express myself as good as you just did. At all.
[11/28/19, 3:11:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: You can keep going, I actually enjoy it.
[11/28/19, 3:12:08 PM] Luc: I'm just bitter cause I'd rather sit in my living room than get up and go to Florida haha
[11/28/19, 3:12:29 PM] Luc: I'm lazy enough that I took a taxi all the way home.
[11/28/19, 3:12:44 PM] Luc: I don't have okay _Everything is on Fire _ üòõ
[11/28/19, 3:12:49 PM] Luc: Play*
[11/28/19, 3:12:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahahaha
[11/28/19, 3:13:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Once a day is more than enough
[11/28/19, 3:15:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm avoiding all type of contact with the driver, so my battery is draining. This is not a good plan.
[11/28/19, 3:43:27 PM] Luc: I got my butacas

[11/28/19, 3:44:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: At the flea market?
[11/28/19, 3:45:18 PM] Luc: Yes just in time as well
[11/28/19, 3:45:31 PM] Luc: Another chab√≥n came inquiring
[11/28/19, 3:45:39 PM] Luc: But I had da cash in hand you feel me
[11/28/19, 3:47:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: They look great!
[11/28/19, 3:47:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs a good mismatch.
[11/28/19, 3:47:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Show off
[11/28/19, 3:49:22 PM] Luc: I went downtown into a sketchy office building for this!
[11/28/19, 3:55:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha true that
[11/28/19, 3:55:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: You deserve them more than the other chabon
[11/28/19, 4:00:09 PM] Luc: Said goodbye to your boys?
[11/28/19, 4:00:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not yet
[11/28/19, 4:00:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Having some tereres on the bus
[11/28/19, 4:05:11 PM] Luc: I'm in return flight hell
[11/28/19, 4:07:36 PM] Luc: I'm probably gonna get so burned but I'm just gonna keep waiting until literally the week before I have to fly home and then I'll look again
[11/28/19, 4:09:23 PM] Luc: Or better yet I'm gonna call them cause they are actually always amazing on the phone
[11/28/19, 4:11:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was thinking about that today. You do have the ticket for the 16th right?
[11/28/19, 4:14:52 PM] Luc: Correct
[11/28/19, 4:14:54 PM] Luc: The return not yet
[11/28/19, 4:15:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: When would that be? Ideally.
[11/28/19, 4:17:27 PM] Luc: From Portland 3/1 or from Austin 6/1
[11/28/19, 4:17:37 PM] Luc: My step sisters are throwing a fit that I come and see them
[11/28/19, 4:19:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: You should..
[11/28/19, 4:20:33 PM] Luc: I saw them in September
[11/28/19, 4:21:52 PM] Luc: I'm just stuck cause
[11/28/19, 4:22:10 PM] Luc: I don't want to fly back economy. Not just for the comfort thing (being tall sucks sometimes)
[11/28/19, 4:22:16 PM] Luc: But because it makes more sense
[11/28/19, 4:22:59 PM] Luc: the return flight in economy: ~$1000 _or_ 30,000 points.
the return flight in business: ~$4500 _or_ 57,500 points.
[11/28/19, 4:23:53 PM] Luc: in economy, a point is worth ~3.33 cents
in business, a point is worth ~8 cents
[11/28/19, 4:24:29 PM] Luc: So I sort of sell myself short, even before you consider how much nicer it is to do a long-haul flight in business rather than economy
‚Äé[11/28/19, 4:26:09 PM] Luc: ‚Äésticker omitted
[11/28/19, 4:33:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: You are definitely gonna need a better argument than that, sir
[11/28/19, 4:34:14 PM] Luc: I don't want to say that your cellular reception is awful
[11/28/19, 4:34:22 PM] Luc: but it's certainly not much better than awful
[11/28/19, 4:35:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I‚Äôm in the middle of nowhere
[11/28/19, 4:35:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs a miracle that I have any
[11/28/19, 4:36:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: I really need to be at the school by now haha
[11/28/19, 4:49:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm not sure if I got it.
[11/28/19, 4:50:07 PM] Luc: do you follow my math? if I divide the dollar value of a flight by how many points it costs, I get a standardized "dollar value per point" number
[11/28/19, 4:50:21 PM] Luc: so in order to utilize my points to capture the most dollar value, I need to maximize that number
[11/28/19, 4:50:39 PM] Luc: it's a simplistic analysis but it's just to illustrate that i'm not cheto, i'm just a good rational consumer
[11/28/19, 4:52:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Now I got it!
[11/28/19, 4:52:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap, it makes perfect sense
[11/28/19, 4:53:37 PM] Luc: üôÉ
[11/28/19, 4:53:44 PM] Luc: This is what english day is for
[11/28/19, 4:54:37 PM] Luc: to talk about internet speed, distortions caused by stupid monetary policy, and airline mile value optimization
[11/28/19, 5:03:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I‚Äôm not seizing Spanish days enough.
[11/28/19, 5:03:17 PM] Luc: We talked sacrifces
[11/28/19, 5:12:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Really? Are you gonna compare that with all this?
[11/28/19, 5:13:24 PM] Luc: oh we talked berni today too
[11/28/19, 5:14:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Haha true. I asked my mom about the book.
[11/28/19, 5:14:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm not sure if it is at her place or in Carilo. But now I won‚Äôt stop until I find it.
[11/28/19, 5:15:02 PM] Luc: hahahah
[11/28/19, 5:15:05 PM] Luc: chill
[11/28/19, 5:15:10 PM] Luc: you sound like liam neeson in taken
[11/28/19, 5:15:26 PM] Luc: except you're trying to locate a book about a 20th century argentine artist
[11/28/19, 5:15:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha but I don‚Äôt want to kill the book
[11/28/19, 5:15:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly
[11/28/19, 5:16:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: I feel like I‚Äôve been on the road for 10 hours now.
[11/28/19, 5:17:02 PM] Luc: I can't believe you're still in a bus
[11/28/19, 5:22:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: Neither do I üò©
[11/28/19, 5:23:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: The driver kept talking to me, which I perfectly understand cause it must be really boring for him otherwise.
[11/28/19, 5:26:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: But it‚Äôs awful. Cause he has been hitting on me for a while now. I‚Äôm not used to it, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cool when I‚Äôm clearly showing that I‚Äôm not interested and it makes me so very uncomfortable.
[11/28/19, 5:28:26 PM] Luc: Hahahahah
[11/28/19, 5:28:28 PM] Luc: What does he say?
[11/28/19, 5:28:39 PM] Luc: I'm sorry I shouldn't laugh I know it's actually awful that you have to go through this
[11/28/19, 5:28:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I can‚Äôt like tell him to fuck off cause I still need him to a) get us to the school b) send me some papers after the trip ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/28/19, 5:28:46 PM] Luc: But better to face it with some humor than not

[11/28/19, 6:37:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sure

[11/28/19, 6:37:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: And he got me a chocolate when we stopped. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[11/28/19, 6:37:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: *these things
[11/28/19, 6:37:38 PM] Luc: Hahahaha
[11/28/19, 6:37:56 PM] Luc: Life of a bus driver with a captive audience
[11/28/19, 6:38:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: Just got to the house
[11/28/19, 6:39:00 PM] Luc: Long day
[11/28/19, 6:39:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Wait, why does it say dad?
[11/28/19, 6:40:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh yes.
[11/28/19, 6:40:59 PM] Luc: Cause I'm a daddy?
[11/28/19, 6:50:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: I know. But you don‚Äôt really need the tee to remind everyone..
[11/28/19, 7:07:14 PM] Luc: Hahahaha this is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me
[11/28/19, 7:08:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha
[11/28/19, 7:09:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs a bit too much I think.
[11/28/19, 7:10:09 PM] Luc: It's up there
[11/28/19, 7:10:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Am I ever gonna know why does it said dad? ü§î
[11/28/19, 7:11:21 PM] Luc: That's kind of the joke
[11/28/19, 7:11:48 PM] Luc: Me and will whenever we go somewhere buy the other one a t shirt that says __ dad
[11/28/19, 7:12:24 PM] Luc: Because it's our brand of stupid humor that two young men would wear shirts that say dad on them implying that we have a child that is at least 18 years old
[11/28/19, 7:12:36 PM] Luc: It's clearly not a humor that translates here in Argentina
[11/28/19, 7:14:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/28/19, 7:14:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Now I got it
[11/28/19, 7:17:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: I think it‚Äôs really cool to have that sort of relationships. Sharing the same sense of humor.
[11/28/19, 7:44:41 PM] Luc: Yeah :)
[11/28/19, 7:44:51 PM] Luc: What's up, relaxing? Surveying your bites?
[11/28/19, 7:47:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: The first one. Mates in bed (cause here I have the good AC). I‚Äôll shower in a minute.
[11/28/19, 7:48:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: My bites are way too many and really really red. I don‚Äôt even wanna look at my legs.
[11/28/19, 7:49:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòí
[11/28/19, 7:49:19 PM] Luc: Hahahah
[11/28/19, 7:49:26 PM] Luc: They'll be gone really soon don't worry
[11/28/19, 7:49:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: But at least the only ones that keep itching are the ones in my ankles.
[11/28/19, 7:50:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, I know. It just annoys me to have such a sensitive skin.
[11/28/19, 7:51:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll stop complaining now. I‚Äôm sorry haha.
[11/28/19, 7:52:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: any plans for your evening?
[11/28/19, 7:52:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: Do you have poker night tonight?
[11/28/19, 7:52:19 PM] Luc: Wouldn't everyone itch if they had a bunch of bites?

‚Äé[11/30/19, 8:25:52 PM] Luc: ‚Äéaudio omitted
[11/30/19, 8:27:39 PM] Luc: What's up?
[11/30/19, 8:28:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap, it might be a good idea to wait til you come back.
[11/30/19, 8:29:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Getting ready for tonight. My parents and my niece came by so I got a little bit delayed.
[11/30/19, 8:37:16 PM] Luc: That sounds nice
[11/30/19, 8:37:23 PM] Luc: I'll stay in tonight
[11/30/19, 8:37:32 PM] Luc: Soccer was exhausting
[11/30/19, 8:39:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah! Unexpected visits are the best. (:
[11/30/19, 8:39:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was gonna ask how did that go
[11/30/19, 8:39:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sounds like a good plan. Movie? Series?
[11/30/19, 8:40:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Or a good book?
[11/30/19, 8:41:42 PM] Luc: Projects reading organizing
[11/30/19, 8:45:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Haha great. Much more productive than my nights in.
[11/30/19, 9:08:40 PM] Luc: Haha we will see
[11/30/19, 9:11:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: 168 has the worst frequency on Earth. You were so very lucky yesterday haha.
[11/30/19, 9:11:29 PM] Luc: It was so full
[11/30/19, 9:11:47 PM] Luc: Where's your party?
[11/30/19, 9:14:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: In Almagro
[11/30/19, 9:14:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: I ended up taking another bus üòí
[11/30/19, 9:15:05 PM] Luc: Oh gosh
[11/30/19, 9:15:17 PM] Luc: I wouldn't even
[11/30/19, 9:15:25 PM] Luc: Which one is this?
[11/30/19, 9:15:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha it‚Äôs not that far from Palermo.
[11/30/19, 9:15:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: 71
[11/30/19, 9:16:04 PM] Luc: No sorry I mean which party
[11/30/19, 9:16:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh, sorry
[11/30/19, 9:16:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: The birthday party
[11/30/19, 9:16:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt even try to make it to pilates‚Äô
[11/30/19, 9:16:57 PM] Luc: Heh
[11/30/19, 9:18:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: I haven‚Äôt missed any in 8 years. I get to skip one haha.
[11/30/19, 9:20:07 PM] Luc: 8 years of pilates?
[11/30/19, 9:20:24 PM] Luc: Do you have thighs of steel hahaha
[11/30/19, 9:20:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yes sir, I was still in high school when I started.
[11/30/19, 9:21:59 PM] Luc: Wow dedication
[11/30/19, 9:22:05 PM] Luc: Why pilates of all things?
[11/30/19, 9:25:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: At that time I was still doing artistic roller skating and I needed to improve my elasticity.
[11/30/19, 9:25:24 PM] Luc: I'm going to save that message for posterity
[11/30/19, 9:25:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha
[11/30/19, 9:25:50 PM] Luc: As a decent human I try not to make fun of others but it's really hard with a message that includes "artistic roller skating" AND elasticity
[11/30/19, 9:26:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Fair enough
[11/30/19, 9:26:17 PM] Luc: You're weird I like you
[11/30/19, 9:26:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was going to say that now I can make the coolest stuff. But I‚Äôll probably won‚Äôt.
[11/30/19, 9:26:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve given you enough material for one day.
[11/30/19, 9:26:50 PM] Luc: Hahaha tomorrow tell me
[11/30/19, 9:27:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: I can show you
[11/30/19, 9:27:43 PM] Luc: Even better
[11/30/19, 9:27:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: (If I find the video)
[11/30/19, 9:28:32 PM] Luc: Of art√≠stic rollerblading?
[11/30/19, 9:30:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh no, pilates. I haven‚Äôt done that in a while.
[11/30/19, 9:32:34 PM] Luc: Make or do?
[11/30/19, 9:32:43 PM] Luc: Maybe I just have no idea what pilates actually is
[11/30/19, 9:32:47 PM] Luc: üôä
[11/30/19, 9:32:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Do
[11/30/19, 9:32:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: You are right
‚Äé[11/30/19, 9:33:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äévideo omitted
[11/30/19, 9:33:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: There you go
[11/30/19, 9:33:50 PM] Luc: WHAT
[11/30/19, 9:34:00 PM] Luc: Omg let's see this
[11/30/19, 9:34:26 PM] Luc: What in the world
[11/30/19, 9:34:35 PM] Luc: Is this
[11/30/19, 9:34:43 PM] Luc: I thought it was like a different name for yoga
[11/30/19, 9:35:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/30/19, 9:35:31 PM] Luc: I mean I'm impressed for sure
[11/30/19, 9:36:04 PM] Luc: But it's like when someone shows you that they can wiggle their ears and you're so confused by how they do it that it takes a while to appreciate
[11/30/19, 9:37:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs not traditional pilates. I mean, the other machine that you  usually see is the most common one. But my instructor knows that I‚Äôm into this kind of acrobatic stuff.
[11/30/19, 9:38:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I can‚Äôt wiggle my ears. For what it‚Äôs worth.
[11/30/19, 9:38:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Still, yes. I‚Äôm quite weird.
[11/30/19, 9:39:17 PM] Luc: Nah i just didn't know you were there doing flips and shit on a Friday night!
[11/30/19, 9:39:21 PM] Luc: I thought it was like
[11/30/19, 9:39:25 PM] Luc: Everyone on their mat
[11/30/19, 9:39:27 PM] Luc: Gossiping
[11/30/19, 9:39:31 PM] Luc: Etc.?
[11/30/19, 9:39:37 PM] Luc: That's really sexist of me I'm sure
[11/30/19, 9:39:40 PM] Luc: But it's from movies
[11/30/19, 9:39:45 PM] Luc: You know
[11/30/19, 9:39:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha we do gossip.
[11/30/19, 9:40:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: But most people think it‚Äôs like the most boring (and least sportive) activity. I completely disagree.
[11/30/19, 9:44:06 PM] Luc: Argentines are competitive
[11/30/19, 9:46:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs probably true.
[11/30/19, 9:46:18 PM] Luc: Anything that includes a ball becomes competitive
[11/30/19, 9:46:34 PM] Luc: Anything that includes commerce? No way
[11/30/19, 9:46:37 PM] Luc: üòõ
[11/30/19, 9:47:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[11/30/19, 9:47:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: That was mean, extranjero
[11/30/19, 9:47:39 PM] Luc: I'm salty tonight
[11/30/19, 9:47:49 PM] Luc: Also literally
[11/30/19, 9:47:54 PM] Luc: Cause I haven't showered yet
[11/30/19, 9:47:56 PM] Luc: I'm stickyyyy
[11/30/19, 9:48:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha sexy
[11/30/19, 9:48:50 PM] Luc: So sexy
[11/30/19, 9:51:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: Go shower. I won‚Äôt stop you any longer.
[11/30/19, 9:51:24 PM] Luc: Yes maaaam
[11/30/19, 9:51:30 PM] Luc: You're arriving soon?
[11/30/19, 9:52:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not yet
[11/30/19, 9:54:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: If I‚Äôm not mistaken, I‚Äôm about to pass by your beloved Chacarita
[11/30/19, 10:05:16 PM] Luc: Nice! Quick tip: if you listen closely you can hear the sounds of the nocturros waking up and exiting their nests
[11/30/19, 10:05:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Please define _nocturros_
[11/30/19, 10:06:07 PM] Luc: Nocturnal Turros
[11/30/19, 10:06:27 PM] Luc: It's a term thats been around
[11/30/19, 10:06:32 PM] Luc: For 90 seconds now
[11/30/19, 10:06:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[11/30/19, 10:07:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Dead turros?
[11/30/19, 10:07:28 PM] Luc: Nocturnal like, awake by night asleep by day
[11/30/19, 10:07:31 PM] Luc: Like a vampire
[11/30/19, 10:08:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Got it. I wasn‚Äôt sure if you meant like those around or those inside the cemetery.
[11/30/19, 10:10:38 PM] Luc: Yeah to be honest with you I didn't put a lot of thought into it
[11/30/19, 10:10:50 PM] Luc: The word nocturro came to me and I wanted to build an idea around it
[11/30/19, 10:12:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahahaha
[12/1/19, 12:27:40 AM] Luc: Ya me duermo, estoy muerto

[12/1/19, 3:04:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: Tengo mucho vino encima. Pero creo que en un ratito ya encaro para casa.

[12/1/19, 3:10:39 AM] Luc: Matear!

[12/2/19, 2:00:10 AM] Luc: How did you do it?
[12/2/19, 2:00:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha I was gonna ask the very same question
[12/2/19, 2:01:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt want to interrupt your cooking.
[12/2/19, 2:01:43 AM] Luc: Nah
[12/2/19, 2:01:50 AM] Luc: I've got a whole night
[12/2/19, 2:02:01 AM] Luc: How's the bus?
[12/2/19, 2:02:08 AM] Luc: I love the bus at night it goes so fast
[12/2/19, 2:02:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: Great. I‚Äôm already in Cabildo.
[12/2/19, 2:02:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly!
[12/2/19, 2:04:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm going to admit something.. I wasn‚Äôt gonna make any move, cause it was your place and it would have been completely out of line. But I totally would have.
[12/2/19, 2:06:29 AM] Luc: I'm really sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable by _not_ making a move
[12/2/19, 2:08:29 AM] Luc: I'm really rather slow in general until I feel comfortable with someone. Which I totally do with you, really
[12/2/19, 2:08:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Oh no, you didn‚Äôt at all!
[12/2/19, 2:09:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: Same here
[12/2/19, 2:09:05 AM] Luc: I dunno. I'm sorry if that makes you feel unwanted. I'm awfully uncomfortable with PDA so basically in public I'm just weird
[12/2/19, 2:09:44 AM] Luc: At home I guess not but also I'm pretty happy sitting next to you and watching a show and talking, I'm glad to have your company
[12/2/19, 2:10:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: So do I! A lot.
[12/2/19, 2:11:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: (One sec, I‚Äôm about to get off the bus)

[12/2/19, 2:41:41 AM] Luc: Chores, sleep?

[12/2/19, 2:43:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: How about you? How‚Äôs your quinoa going?
[12/2/19, 2:43:29 AM] Luc: Just finished tuppering it
[12/2/19, 2:43:42 AM] Luc: The avocados were good, really good

[12/2/19, 2:44:40 AM] Luc: Ago I started
[12/2/19, 2:44:45 AM] Luc: So not _that_ fast
[12/2/19, 2:45:34 AM] Anita Zuddio: You are probably right. But still faster than the 168.
[12/2/19, 2:45:47 AM] Luc: Hey I hope you don't feel like I'm changing the subject from the above, if there was something more you wanted to add or ask I'm here
[12/2/19, 2:46:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt mean to brag, but I still have 71% of battery. That shows how little did I touch my phone during the day actually.
[12/2/19, 2:46:59 AM] Luc: ScreenTime?
[12/2/19, 2:48:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: What‚Äôs that? ü§î
[12/2/19, 2:48:48 AM] Luc: Tells you how long you used your phone!
[12/2/19, 2:49:37 AM] Luc: You've never looked at it?
[12/2/19, 2:49:41 AM] Luc: Oh it's great Ani!
[12/2/19, 2:49:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: O h This?
‚Äé[12/2/19, 2:49:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[12/2/19, 2:50:18 AM] Luc: Technically no but that's cool Haha
[12/2/19, 2:50:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
‚Äé[12/2/19, 2:50:44 AM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[12/2/19, 2:51:45 AM] Anita Zuddio: I had it off apparently ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[12/2/19, 2:52:03 AM] Luc: You're off the radar apparently
[12/2/19, 2:52:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, first google, now this
[12/2/19, 2:52:38 AM] Luc: I'm glad actually
[12/2/19, 2:52:53 AM] Luc: You're wrenching back control of some privacy
[12/2/19, 2:53:04 AM] Luc: Which I've already given up without much of a fight
[12/2/19, 2:58:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: About this. Not at all, I‚Äôm sorry if it came out the wrong way. I guess I‚Äôm used to guys going fast (and I don‚Äôt say it as a good thing at all). And I didn‚Äôt want you to think that I‚Äôm not into you for not making any move so far. I‚Äôm quite shy, you must have noticed already. And I guess I take my time as well, until I feel comfortable with the other person.
[12/2/19, 2:58:52 AM] Anita Zuddio: (It took me ages to write that, it‚Äôs the hour, I‚Äôm sorry)
[12/2/19, 2:59:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: But I‚Äôm glad we are on the same page
[12/2/19, 2:59:16 AM] Luc: Hahaha don't worry
[12/2/19, 2:59:21 AM] Luc: Yes :)
[12/2/19, 3:00:21 AM] Luc: Sorry for not having a lengthier response, I think Yes :) sums it up rather nicely
[12/2/19, 3:00:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha it does
[12/2/19, 3:01:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: We spent half the day together and I forgot to ask you something, but I‚Äôll keep it for tomorrow.
[12/2/19, 3:01:07 AM] Luc: It's a cultural thing too. And it's a me thing
[12/2/19, 3:01:40 AM] Luc: As you wish!
[12/2/19, 3:02:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm just gonna ask you for a recommendation
[12/2/19, 3:03:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: But my eyes are closing right now
[12/2/19, 3:03:26 AM] Luc: Best saucepan?
[12/2/19, 3:03:34 AM] Luc: I prefer tramontina
[12/2/19, 3:03:40 AM] Luc: Stainless steel everything
[12/2/19, 3:03:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[12/2/19, 3:03:48 AM] Luc: As you will have noted
[12/2/19, 3:03:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: Essen!
[12/2/19, 3:04:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: But it wasn‚Äôt that. Although it also has to do with food, of course.
[12/2/19, 3:04:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[12/2/19, 3:04:44 AM] Luc: Me dejas con la intriga
[12/2/19, 3:04:47 AM] Luc: :(
[12/2/19, 3:04:57 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/2/19, 3:05:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: Well, I ask you and you give me your answer tomorrow.
[12/2/19, 3:05:21 AM] Luc: Okay okay
[12/2/19, 3:05:24 AM] Luc: Sleep well
[12/2/19, 3:05:26 AM] Luc: üòòüòò
[12/2/19, 3:06:58 AM] Anita Zuddio: Best Indian food in town? I have this craving for some good chicken tikka masala or similar (my favorite Indian dish probably). And I think you might be the best source for that.
[12/2/19, 3:07:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: You too üòòüòò
[12/2/19, 11:00:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Morning! (:
[12/2/19, 11:01:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: Did you sleep well?
[12/2/19, 12:40:42 PM] Luc: I just woke up üôä
[12/2/19, 12:43:02 PM] Luc: Oopsy
[12/2/19, 12:54:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: Biggest show off EVER maybe?
[12/2/19, 12:54:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/2/19, 12:59:11 PM] Luc: Oh so you woke up today and put on your jealousy pants I see?
[12/2/19, 12:59:23 PM] Luc: Sorry for living the dream!
[12/2/19, 1:00:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs part of the uniform
[12/2/19, 1:00:41 PM] Luc: Ironing them just takes _forever_
[12/2/19, 1:00:59 PM] Luc: So did you do anything wrong for which you're being punished today?
[12/2/19, 1:06:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[12/2/19, 1:07:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Not yet. But I can see her coming.
[12/2/19, 1:07:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: She‚Äôs being a pain in the ass with my mate today.
[12/2/19, 1:07:38 PM] Luc: with your mate?
[12/2/19, 1:09:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Too British? With my.. coworker?
[12/2/19, 1:10:45 PM] Luc: _oh_
[12/2/19, 1:11:00 PM] Luc: I thought you meant she was unhappy because you were so sleepy that you were drinking mate
[12/2/19, 1:11:13 PM] Luc: and I remembered at some point you said there was no mate in your office
[12/2/19, 1:11:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I WISH
[12/2/19, 1:11:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. No mate.
[12/2/19, 1:12:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äòve told you she is really intense. Today she complained with him because he wrote some numbers with the dot after the 3rd figure and some without. LITERALLY.
[12/2/19, 1:12:19 PM] Luc: Best part of yesterday was when you got all flustered and said _"I'm in charge of the Mate"_
[12/2/19, 1:13:07 PM] Luc: This is called obsessive compulsion and it's not your responsibility to solve this problem
[12/2/19, 1:13:17 PM] Luc: real talk.
[12/2/19, 1:13:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm a grammar nazi, which includes punctuation, so I don‚Äôt usually get bothered about that.
[12/2/19, 1:13:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: But come on, let him be.
[12/2/19, 1:13:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I‚Äôm sorry
[12/2/19, 1:15:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Couldn‚Äôt help myself
[12/2/19, 1:17:10 PM] Luc: nah I prefer it
[12/2/19, 1:17:15 PM] Luc: it's a lot of pressure and I'm absent minded
[12/2/19, 1:17:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: No pressure at all
[12/2/19, 1:17:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Really, worst case scenario I‚Äôll take over.... again.. üòÖ
[12/2/19, 1:20:49 PM] Luc: The mate is yours to handle
[12/2/19, 1:21:01 PM] Luc: also, yes
[12/2/19, 1:21:06 PM] Luc: way too british
[12/2/19, 1:21:12 PM] Luc: my soul hurts
[12/2/19, 1:21:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry
[12/2/19, 1:22:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Didn‚Äôt mean to do that to you on a Monday.
[12/2/19, 1:22:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs such a nice day outside!
[12/2/19, 1:22:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Are you heading somewhere?
[12/2/19, 1:22:47 PM] Luc: I've got a meeting at 4
[12/2/19, 1:23:02 PM] Luc: I'll work until then, then I'll go to the gym, then I'll liberate myself for the day
[12/2/19, 1:23:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sounds great
[12/2/19, 1:24:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: I can only think of taking a nap üò¥
[12/2/19, 1:24:48 PM] Luc: not too far into the future you'll be able to
[12/2/19, 1:24:52 PM] Luc: no classes tonight!
[12/2/19, 1:25:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: The good thing about having to many things to catch up with here is that the day is going by really fast.
[12/2/19, 1:25:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh yes üôåüèº
[12/2/19, 1:25:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Speaking of which. Are you up to an episode of El Marginal?
[12/2/19, 1:26:49 PM] Luc: silver linings!
[12/2/19, 1:28:34 PM] Luc: depends what you mean, I think I could watch one at some point tonight if you wanna stay in sync
[12/2/19, 1:28:56 PM] Luc: but i think for the sake of my sanity i need to have a night where i'm actually more productive than not and as such I wouldn't be a very fun host
[12/2/19, 1:29:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh no, I‚Äôm intense but not _that_ much.
[12/2/19, 1:30:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: You got a good dose of Ani yesterday haha
[12/2/19, 1:30:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: I meant to stay in sync
[12/2/19, 1:31:38 PM] Luc: üåö
[12/2/19, 1:31:47 PM] Luc: oh absolutely then :)
[12/2/19, 1:32:33 PM] Luc: SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION from last night
[12/2/19, 1:33:07 PM] Luc: There is very little that _Luc_ being the asshole that he is considers good Indian food here in BA
[12/2/19, 1:33:34 PM] Luc: I've tried a couple restaurants and a closed door cooked by a really nice immigrant from northern india
[12/2/19, 1:33:54 PM] Luc: more in the onda of chicken/lamb curries (northern indian cuisine)
[12/2/19, 1:34:46 PM] Luc: _Mumbai_ was decent (on Gorriti I think), but the guys who run it are actually Pakistani from what I gathered
[12/2/19, 1:35:37 PM] Luc: If you want to try decent indian food, you'll have to ask yours truly to prepare some for you, and ideally when I come back to I have a fresh batch of spices
[12/2/19, 1:36:44 PM] Luc: If you want some comfort food which isn't bad Mumbai is okay, there was another place in centro which was also decent
[12/2/19, 1:36:47 PM] Luc: delhi mahal?
[12/2/19, 1:36:56 PM] Luc: they make me laugh honestly
[12/2/19, 1:37:28 PM] Luc: like going to india and they have "buenos aires grill" with a massive bull and a cowboy or something ‚ù§
[12/2/19, 1:57:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve heard about Mumbai. It will probably be that one then.
[12/2/19, 1:57:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh no. I wouldn‚Äôt do that to you. No matter how much you like cooking.
[12/2/19, 1:59:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha waaaay too much?
[12/2/19, 2:05:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: So, I asked my sister about the rebozador. She told me that she likes Aglu.
[12/2/19, 2:05:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Did you try that one already?
[12/2/19, 2:06:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: *have you tried
[12/2/19, 2:08:19 PM] Luc: no! i had naturalsur but I saw aglu in the store the other day i'll check it out :)
[12/2/19, 2:12:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÅ
‚Äé[12/2/19, 5:56:52 PM] Luc: ‚Äéaudio omitted
[12/2/19, 6:07:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: That makes me sad and happy at the same time. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it.
[12/2/19, 6:09:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Like, it‚Äôs not the worst outcome, cause they get to live longer. But then it is, cause it worked exactly the opposite way than expected.
[12/2/19, 6:09:32 PM] Luc: I think it's a good example of a human problem and a human solution
[12/2/19, 6:09:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Develop that idea
[12/2/19, 6:20:21 PM] Luc: Like that sometimes we don't even know what type of war we're fighting
[12/2/19, 6:20:32 PM] Luc: And you can be tragically valiant in a misguided effort
[12/2/19, 6:24:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well yes, and at the same time is the only way to go I guess.
‚Äé[12/2/19, 7:10:15 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[12/2/19, 8:25:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/2/19, 8:25:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: Your are being followed
[12/2/19, 8:52:22 PM] Luc: Apparently
[12/2/19, 8:57:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Let‚Äôs pretend that I wrote that properly haha.
[12/2/19, 9:08:55 PM] Luc: I was already pretending üòò
[12/2/19, 9:09:03 PM] Luc: How are you, how was your day?
[12/2/19, 9:16:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahah thanks a lot üòÅ
[12/2/19, 9:18:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Good! The afternoon not that much, I got this pretty nasty headache. But I woke up feeling much better fortunately. So now I‚Äôm cooking.
[12/2/19, 9:18:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: How about yours?
[12/2/19, 9:44:05 PM] Luc: I'm beat
[12/2/19, 9:44:11 PM] Luc: Gonna try to sleep earlier tonight
[12/2/19, 9:44:22 PM] Luc: Went to the gym so I'm fully out of energy hahah
[12/2/19, 9:50:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sounds like a good plan
[12/2/19, 9:50:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: What does ‚Äúearlier‚Äù mean for you tho?
[12/2/19, 9:55:43 PM] Luc: Ideally before or by 1
[12/2/19, 10:00:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh okay. It‚Äôs not early but not that late either haha.
[12/2/19, 10:00:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Are you having a productive night as you wanted?
[12/2/19, 10:00:56 PM] Luc: It's _reasonable_
[12/2/19, 10:01:04 PM] Luc: Yes!
[12/2/19, 10:01:27 PM] Luc: Currently reading. So gonna put my phone down. Will check back in 30 or so
[12/2/19, 10:01:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sorry about that!
[12/2/19, 10:02:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Go enjoy yourself (:
[12/2/19, 10:33:23 PM] Luc: Quite a book
[12/2/19, 10:33:30 PM] Luc: Just finished
[12/2/19, 10:34:41 PM] Luc: Really beautiful writing
[12/2/19, 10:34:53 PM] Luc: _In the year she knew him, before they were married, she discovered a little magic in herself, and for a while felt like a blithe genie released from her lamp. She was perhaps too young to realize that what she assumed was her love for Chacko was actually a tentative, timorous acceptance of herself. _
[12/2/19, 10:35:28 PM] Luc: Or maybe this one
[12/2/19, 10:35:50 PM] Luc: _They were not friends, Comrade Pillai and Inspector Thomas Mathew, and they didn't trust each other. But they understood each other perfectly. They were both men whom childhood had abandoned without a trace. Men without curiosity. Without doubt. Both in their own way truly, terrifyingly adult. They looked out at the world and never wondered how it worked, because they knew. They worked it. They were mechanics who serviced different parts of the same machine._
[12/2/19, 10:37:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Very nicely written
[12/2/19, 10:38:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Is it the same that you sent me quote last time?
[12/2/19, 10:38:34 PM] Luc: I don't think so but it could be
[12/2/19, 10:38:50 PM] Luc: I only wrote down 4 ir 5
[12/2/19, 10:39:02 PM] Luc: But the others I think require a bit more context
[12/2/19, 10:44:17 PM] Anita Zuddio: Seizing the moment, I just wrote down this quote from the book I‚Äôm reading.
[12/2/19, 10:44:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Worth sharing
[12/2/19, 10:45:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: _Nunca antes hab√≠a experimentado el repentino estremecimiento de comprensi√≥n que viaja desde la palabra hasta el coraz√≥n pasando por el cerebro, la forma en que un idioma nuevo se mueve, se enrosca, cobra vida bajo los ojos, el salto casi salvaje de entendimiento, la liberaci√≥n instant√°nea y dichosa del significado, la forma en que las palabras se despojan de sus cuerpos impresos en un destello de luz y calor.  _
[12/2/19, 10:50:45 PM] Luc: Someone really likes words
[12/2/19, 10:55:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: How couldn‚Äôt I?
[12/2/19, 10:56:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòÖ
[12/2/19, 11:03:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, that‚Äôs probably the nerdiest thing you are gonna read in a while haha. I‚Äôm sorry.
[12/2/19, 11:07:10 PM] Luc: A nearly sexual fascination with words
[12/2/19, 11:07:23 PM] Luc: I'm sure there's a -ilia for that
[12/2/19, 11:12:43 PM] Luc: Anita
[12/2/19, 11:12:46 PM] Luc: Serious question
[12/2/19, 11:13:12 PM] Luc: Did they make the check marks next to messages _longer_ or _taller_ in WhatsApp
[12/2/19, 11:13:43 PM] Luc: I think they did. It's slight but it's noticeable
[12/2/19, 11:14:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: They did
[12/2/19, 11:14:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mine hasn‚Äôt updated yet
[12/2/19, 11:15:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: I noticed with your screenshot
‚Äé[12/2/19, 11:15:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[12/2/19, 11:16:41 PM] Luc: Yeah they did
[12/2/19, 11:16:54 PM] Luc: Well
[12/2/19, 11:16:59 PM] Luc: Glad we got to the bottom of that
[12/2/19, 11:18:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Good. I wouldn‚Äôt want you to lose sleep over such a serious matter.
‚Äé[12/2/19, 11:18:28 PM] Luc: ‚Äéaudio omitted
[12/2/19, 11:19:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: I can hear it as well at the back
[12/2/19, 11:20:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[12/2/19, 11:21:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, it‚Äôs so very distinctive.
[12/2/19, 11:22:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Speaking of voices, you sound like you are absolutely out of bat.
[12/2/19, 11:25:47 PM] Luc: runnin on fumes over here
[12/2/19, 11:28:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs not illegal to be in bed before 12. You know that right?
[12/2/19, 11:32:06 PM] Luc: hahah you're sweet
[12/2/19, 11:32:18 PM] Luc: my brain will find a way to wake up
[12/2/19, 11:32:23 PM] Luc: within the next 30 minutes
[12/2/19, 11:34:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: No idea how that works.
[12/2/19, 11:34:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/2/19, 11:43:22 PM] Luc: how long can this rotten human speak for
[12/2/19, 11:43:35 PM] Luc: Like you think she's just get tired of being indignant _all_ of the time
[12/2/19, 11:45:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh no, she won‚Äôt. Ever. It‚Äôs part of her (very annoying) personality.
[12/2/19, 11:54:36 PM] Luc: RIP Argentina
[12/2/19, 11:54:46 PM] Luc: 1881 - 2019
[12/2/19, 11:58:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: I have no clue of where the hell we are gonna end up.
[12/2/19, 11:59:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: 1881?
[12/3/19, 12:00:53 AM] Luc: No sab√≠a el a√±o y me solo
[12/3/19, 12:01:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja 1816 independencia.
[12/3/19, 12:04:52 AM] Luc: Okay so
[12/3/19, 12:04:58 AM] Luc: Bueno
[12/3/19, 12:05:09 AM] Luc: Igual de significado
[12/3/19, 12:06:47 AM] Luc: Esta noche dorm√≠s? Espero
[12/3/19, 12:10:09 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ya en la cama con caf√© y chocolate. üòÖ
[12/3/19, 12:10:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Claramente me voy a tener que levantar a lavarme los dientes y dem√°s, pero igual. Ya esto me hace muy feliz.
[12/3/19, 12:10:48 AM] Luc: Somos personas tan distintas
[12/3/19, 12:10:51 AM] Luc: Y me copa igual
[12/3/19, 12:11:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja
[12/3/19, 12:11:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Clave la aclaraci√≥n
[12/3/19, 12:13:21 AM] Luc: Hahaha de nada üòò
[12/3/19, 12:14:00 AM] Luc: mereces las noches relajadas
[12/3/19, 12:14:05 AM] Luc: Por lo menos durante un a√±o
[12/3/19, 12:14:29 AM] Luc: Ya que pasaste un a√±o de infierno
[12/3/19, 12:14:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajaja primero tengo que pasar mis ex√°menes
[12/3/19, 12:14:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: Peque√±o detalle
[12/3/19, 12:18:05 AM] Luc: Detalles detalles
[12/3/19, 12:18:14 AM] Luc: Vas aprobando
[12/3/19, 12:18:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ma√±ana empiezo igual. Con tiempo... o algo as√≠.
[12/3/19, 12:20:18 AM] Luc: me recuerda de algo que dijo una amiga de universidad
[12/3/19, 12:20:26 AM] Luc: "diet starts tomorrow"
[12/3/19, 12:20:40 AM] Luc: palabras para la vida
[12/3/19, 12:20:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja
[12/3/19, 12:21:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: No te olvides que yo vivo a dieta hace a√±os. No aplico esa filosof√≠a jaja.
[12/3/19, 12:21:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: Aunque soy bastante buena procrastinando.
[12/3/19, 12:22:18 AM] Luc: hacemos lo mismo entonces üòâ
[12/3/19, 12:22:52 AM] Anita Zuddio: Por razones totalmente diferentes, claro est√°. Pero si.
[12/3/19, 12:24:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: Comentario totalmente aleatorio. Pero me molesta mucho lo lento que pasan las horas en la oficina y lo r√°pido que se me pasan en casa. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[12/3/19, 12:25:14 AM] Luc: tiene nombre esa sensaci√≥n
[12/3/19, 12:26:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: jajaja lo tengo que googlear?
[12/3/19, 12:27:00 AM] Luc: se llama "vida" ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
[12/3/19, 12:27:06 AM] Luc: o sea
[12/3/19, 12:27:11 AM] Luc: ahora que tenes tiempo libre
[12/3/19, 12:27:25 AM] Luc: vas viendo que la felicidad se balanza
[12/3/19, 12:27:52 AM] Luc: al mismo nivel de siempre, mas o menos, con tiempo
[12/3/19, 12:27:59 AM] Luc: pensamiento medio depresivo
[12/3/19, 12:28:24 AM] Luc: de la dimension economica se llama "hedonic treadmill"
[12/3/19, 12:29:18 AM] Luc: y dice que ganando mas de un cierto nivel (en relacion al costo de vida), experimentas [diminishing marginal returns] de felicidad
[12/3/19, 12:31:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: Rendimiento marginal decreciente, cr√©ase o no es as√≠ de literal. (Tengo mi background de econom√≠a aunque no se note nada)
[12/3/19, 12:32:09 AM] Luc: haha gracias
[12/3/19, 12:32:39 AM] Anita Zuddio: O sea que si est√°s por encima de ese nivel, volves hacia atr√°s? Hasta ‚Äúnivelar‚Äù?
[12/3/19, 12:32:50 AM] Anita Zuddio: Si, bastante depresivo
[12/3/19, 12:34:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: No se si te cont√© lo que implement√© este a√±o, para sentir m√°s el poco tiempo que pasaba en casa.
[12/3/19, 12:35:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: Tengo una alarma puesta a las 3 am. Solo para apagarla y saber que tengo 3 hs m√°s de sue√±o por delante.
[12/3/19, 12:35:32 AM] Luc: um
[12/3/19, 12:35:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: Cero sano. Pero mentalmente me serv√≠a.
[12/3/19, 12:36:09 AM] Luc: me gustaria contarte todo que se del tema en tipo 24 horas
[12/3/19, 12:36:37 AM] Luc: pero interrumpis lo que podria ser REM
[12/3/19, 12:36:52 AM] Luc: que te haria sentir mucho peor ma√±ana :O
[12/3/19, 12:37:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: jajaja porque English day?
[12/3/19, 12:38:42 AM] Luc: exacto
[12/3/19, 12:38:54 AM] Luc: si no iria traduciendo un monton de terminos y tal
[12/3/19, 12:39:03 AM] Luc: y en este momento estoy medio muerto, perdon :(
[12/3/19, 12:39:10 AM] Luc: igual es _muy_ interesante
[12/3/19, 12:39:20 AM] Luc: behavioral economics
[12/3/19, 12:39:30 AM] Luc: la interseccion de economia y psicologia
[12/3/19, 12:39:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: No worries. Igual estoy por dormirme.
[12/3/19, 12:39:48 AM] Luc: se puede hasta proyectar cuanto "sale" un evento negativo
[12/3/19, 12:40:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: Y tenemos todo un paseo por delante el mi√©rcoles ‚ò∫
[12/3/19, 12:40:28 AM] Luc: o sea, si ganas unos 100k al a√±o, y divorcias tu pareja, tendrias que ganar ~140k para "nivelar" tu nivel de felicidad
[12/3/19, 12:43:04 AM] Luc: pero en general llegas al entendimiento que
[12/3/19, 12:43:14 AM] Luc: la idea de perseguir siempre mas felicidad
[12/3/19, 12:43:54 AM] Luc: parece linda
[12/3/19, 12:43:58 AM] Luc: pero no tiene sentido
[12/3/19, 12:44:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: En t√©rminos econ√≥micos? O en general?
[12/3/19, 12:45:12 AM] Luc: la felicidad no es un termino economico
[12/3/19, 12:45:19 AM] Luc: perdon me cuesta escribirlo asi
[12/3/19, 12:45:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: No, claramente.
[12/3/19, 12:45:27 AM] Luc: porque parece maleducado
[12/3/19, 12:45:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pero que tenga sentido o no perseguirla si puede analizarse desde lo econ√≥mico (o no)
[12/3/19, 12:45:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: Por eso preguntaba
[12/3/19, 12:46:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: No se si me estoy explicando
[12/3/19, 12:46:20 AM] Luc: <english>
[12/3/19, 12:46:44 AM] Luc: I think you're conflating economics and happiness as if we were talking about money and happiness
[12/3/19, 12:46:53 AM] Luc: and it's my fault, because I sort of put that into the conversation
[12/3/19, 12:47:22 AM] Luc: but generally behavioral economics just seeks to apply more robust economic models and statistical techniques to psychological phenomena
[12/3/19, 12:47:24 AM] Luc: </english>
[12/3/19, 12:47:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: jajajajaja
[12/3/19, 12:48:05 AM] Anita Zuddio: No sab√≠a que pod√≠amos hacer eso
[12/3/19, 12:48:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Te estaba siguiendo igual
[12/3/19, 12:48:20 AM] Luc: :D
[12/3/19, 12:48:44 AM] Luc: la psicologia es fascinante
[12/3/19, 12:49:27 AM] Luc: y en la economia tenemos una idea del ser humano como un consumidor racional y tal que realmente es muy reduccionista
[12/3/19, 12:51:30 AM] Luc: asi bueno, los dos rubros van de a mano.. la psicolog√≠a puede ayudar a la econom√≠a a formar una idea mas robusta de como reaccion√° un ser humano ante varias situaciones, en varios ambientes. y la economia puede ayudar a la psicolog√≠a a implementar metodos menos anecdoticos
[12/3/19, 12:51:39 AM] Anita Zuddio: Estaba pensando en eso exactamente
[12/3/19, 12:53:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Por eso te pregunt√© si con esto te refer√≠as a en t√©rminos econ√≥micos o en general. O sea, decir que no tiene sentido perseguirla me parece una racionalizaci√≥n fr√≠a.
[12/3/19, 12:54:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pero que puede llegar a tener sentido tomando la teor√≠a de la que me hablabas.
[12/3/19, 12:54:51 AM] Luc: Creo en general que no tiene mucho sentido.
[12/3/19, 12:55:04 AM] Luc: No como filosof√≠a de vida
[12/3/19, 12:55:18 AM] Luc: Pero como realidad de c√≥mo es nuestro organismo
[12/3/19, 12:55:31 AM] Luc: Y teniendo en cuenta el detalle no tan peque√±o
[12/3/19, 12:55:45 AM] Luc: El cual es
[12/3/19, 12:56:21 AM] Luc: Que persiguiendo m√°s felicidad y pensando que todav√≠a no llegaste a ser feliz te hace infeliz.
[12/3/19, 12:58:22 AM] Luc: Y que bueno. Como meta es muy dif√≠cil definir
[12/3/19, 12:58:48 AM] Luc: Y que definirla como meta y no como externalidad de lograr otras metas...
[12/3/19, 12:59:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ok, si. Visto as√≠, seguro. No lo tom√© as√≠ porque no lo vivo as√≠. Para mi la felicidad est√° en las peque√±as cosas diarias. Y eso si es sanamente perseguible.
[12/3/19, 1:02:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: Quiz√°s fue demasiado subjetiva la apreciaci√≥n para lo objetivo del tema jaja.
[12/3/19, 1:03:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Perd√≥n, me se cierran los ojitos.
[12/3/19, 1:03:31 AM] Luc: que descanses :)
[12/3/19, 1:03:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Reten√© las ideas y lo hablamos au vivo.
[12/3/19, 1:03:42 AM] Luc: hablamos ma√±ana üòò
[12/3/19, 1:04:05 AM] Anita Zuddio: Que descanses vos tmb üòò
[12/3/19, 2:52:40 AM] Luc: Claro que son las 3 y sigo despierto

[12/3/19, 4:59:58 PM] Luc: Ser√° mejor forzarte derivar lo que quer√≠a decir
[12/3/19, 5:00:39 PM] Luc: Que pasa si cambiamos el l√≠mite a 100 d√≥lares? O a 1000 d√≥lares? O  sacamos el l√≠mite enteramente?
[12/3/19, 5:15:43 PM] Luc: perdon, estoy frustrado porque tambien no me sale lo que necesito hacer para mi trabajo
[12/3/19, 5:16:09 PM] Luc: y nada, en las dos cosas siento impotente

[12/3/19, 6:03:03 PM] Luc: no adivinarias cuales son las infracciones mas mortales
[12/3/19, 6:04:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: No, pero me intrigaste ya
[12/3/19, 6:05:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Antes de trabajar donde estoy ahora, trabaj√© unos a√±os para una aseguradora. Vi de todo.

[12/6/19, 12:01:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/6/19, 12:01:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: You‚Äôre right
[12/6/19, 12:01:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not much more than what I already told you
[12/6/19, 12:02:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: I couldn‚Äôt make up my mind about what to wear for tomorrow‚Äôs party at work.
[12/6/19, 12:03:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: But I‚Äôll probably decide tomorrow morning cause I wanna study a while longer before heading to bed
[12/6/19, 12:03:17 AM] Luc: Yeah, is it very formal?
[12/6/19, 12:03:24 AM] Luc: It begins!
[12/6/19, 12:03:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not really. That‚Äôs the problem. It‚Äôs like in between formal and casual haha.
[12/6/19, 12:04:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: So I‚Äôll probably wear a dress. But not too high heels. And I have to choose the right dress (one that isn‚Äôt too short).
[12/6/19, 12:05:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: It doesn‚Äôt get any girlier. I‚Äôm sorry
[12/6/19, 12:05:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahah
[12/6/19, 12:05:16 AM] Luc: Better to err on the side of formal
[12/6/19, 12:05:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: Absolutely
[12/6/19, 12:05:31 AM] Luc: I have 4 sisters and a mother
[12/6/19, 12:05:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha true that
[12/6/19, 12:05:55 AM] Anita Zuddio: It was about time!
[12/6/19, 12:06:18 AM] Luc: Feeling good about it or nah
[12/6/19, 12:08:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: Not yet. That will probably happen after I‚Äôve refreshed the things I‚Äôve already studied.
[12/6/19, 12:09:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: I mean, after I have covered quite a few topics.
[12/6/19, 12:10:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: But this is just to be prepared. At the end of the day, all the exams I have left depend on how well I do in my translations.
[12/6/19, 12:10:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: We‚Äôll see
[12/6/19, 12:10:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: Are you back home already?

[12/6/19, 12:11:31 AM] Luc: I used to go and have to drink a full bottle
[12/6/19, 12:11:36 AM] Luc: You can imagine how that went
[12/6/19, 12:11:59 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahahaha
[12/6/19, 12:12:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: I can imagine
[12/6/19, 12:12:45 AM] Luc: Chacarita is simply the best. That party is so good
[12/6/19, 12:12:57 AM] Luc: Like there's no drama and everyone is having a good time and is genuinely happy
[12/6/19, 12:13:01 AM] Luc: That feels so rare
[12/6/19, 12:13:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sounds great, for what you‚Äôve told me.
[12/6/19, 12:14:32 AM] Luc: I'm zealous in general

[12/6/19, 12:23:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: Are we preparing milanesas tomorrow night (tonight) then?
[12/6/19, 12:24:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: If so, I need to stop by the supermarket on my way back from work. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking mostly.
[12/6/19, 12:40:49 AM] Luc: Hi! Yes I'd like to if it can be a totally tranqui night in?

[12/6/19, 12:58:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm so very much in love with my living room right now.

[12/6/19, 1:00:16 AM] Luc: But I had to find at least one imperfection
[12/6/19, 1:02:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs temporary. I still have to get a bookshelf, it‚Äôll go there.
[12/6/19, 1:02:40 AM] Luc: Hahah tranqui

[12/6/19, 1:08:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm really proud of the box idea (thank you Pinterest). I cut the back side to put the cables inside. But just enough so that you wouldn‚Äôt notice.

[12/6/19, 5:15:13 PM] Luc: I understand entirely
[12/6/19, 5:15:26 PM] Luc: I appreciate you being flexible with me, I hope you're not disappointed
[12/6/19, 5:17:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: I am, but not with you. With the whole idea of a good night haha.
[12/6/19, 5:18:08 PM] Luc: i'm looking forward to it really! i just wouldn't be much fun tonight so i think it's better to save it for another night when i can be more energetic and attentive
[12/6/19, 5:18:11 PM] Luc: for the cooking show hahaha
[12/6/19, 5:21:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs ok
[12/6/19, 5:22:26 PM] Luc: ):
[12/6/19, 5:22:31 PM] Luc: descancelemos
[12/6/19, 5:46:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh no, it‚Äôs fine. Really.
[12/6/19, 7:15:40 PM] Luc: Really?
[12/6/19, 7:16:07 PM] Luc: I just got back from the gym and I showered
[12/6/19, 7:16:18 PM] Luc: Are you still at your party? Or Pilates? Or something else entirely?
[12/6/19, 8:33:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hi. I‚Äôm sorry.
[12/6/19, 8:33:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pilates
[12/6/19, 8:33:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Just got home
[12/6/19, 8:33:38 PM] Luc: Hey! No, please
[12/6/19, 8:33:42 PM] Luc: I imagined as much
[12/6/19, 8:36:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: How was your afternoon?
[12/6/19, 8:36:49 PM] Luc: My morning was like a 4
[12/6/19, 8:36:57 PM] Luc: My afternoon was like a 5
[12/6/19, 8:37:13 PM] Luc: And I'm back down at a 4 currently because I'm feeling like I hurt your feelings
[12/6/19, 8:37:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: Don‚Äôt!
[12/6/19, 8:38:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve just had a crappy day (in spite of the party). But it wasn‚Äôt you at all.
[12/6/19, 8:38:48 PM] Luc: Care to elaborate?
[12/6/19, 8:40:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: My boss is a pain in the ass. And she intensifies when we have big events. I‚Äôve been running all day to get shit done. And I broke my phone in the process.
[12/6/19, 8:41:45 PM] Luc: The screen posta or just the cover?
[12/6/19, 8:42:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well, the glass. But I‚Äôm really careful, as you may imagine. So it really pisses me off to see it like this.
[12/6/19, 8:43:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: And let‚Äôs pretend that I haven‚Äôt said _really_ in every single sentence.
[12/6/19, 8:43:26 PM] Luc: Really is a really important word. Really.
[12/6/19, 8:43:33 PM] Luc: But wait
[12/6/19, 8:43:36 PM] Luc: Your phone broke
[12/6/19, 8:43:39 PM] Luc: The main screen
[12/6/19, 8:43:44 PM] Luc: The glass cracked or shattered
[12/6/19, 8:43:51 PM] Luc: ? I'd be pissed too
[12/6/19, 8:44:02 PM] Luc: But if your phone screen _protector_ broke
[12/6/19, 8:44:24 PM] Luc: I recommend you take a few deep breaths and get it replaced for like 400 pesos
[12/6/19, 8:44:26 PM] Luc: Haha
[12/6/19, 8:44:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: This is it.
[12/6/19, 8:44:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: I will
[12/6/19, 8:44:47 PM] Luc: I'm sorry your boss sucks
[12/6/19, 8:44:52 PM] Luc: I'm sorry I suck too
[12/6/19, 8:45:00 PM] Luc: I've been accumulating tiredness this week
[12/6/19, 8:45:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: You don‚Äôt.
[12/6/19, 8:45:27 PM] Luc: I need to do a better job of just doing _less_
[12/6/19, 8:45:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs partly my fault actually
[12/6/19, 8:46:31 PM] Luc: Not in the slightest
[12/6/19, 8:46:52 PM] Luc: Probably I need iron supplements üòõ
[12/6/19, 8:48:21 PM] Luc: Because it's not sleepiness, it's genuine _fatigue_. Like exhausted walking up my stairs kinda stuff. And I'm not out of shape. And they told me this would happen. And I sort of just ignored them.
[12/6/19, 8:48:34 PM] Luc: Such is life
[12/6/19, 8:49:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Shouldn‚Äôt you see your doctor? I might tell you to add something to your diet.. or effectively start taking iron supplements.
[12/6/19, 8:49:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: *he
[12/6/19, 8:50:00 PM] Luc: I see him quite enough, lol
[12/6/19, 8:50:15 PM] Luc: Yeah yeah. I'll get some spinach and eat more beef.
[12/6/19, 8:50:51 PM] Luc: I can take care of myself, I promise. Just occasionally I get a reminder that I'm more fragile than I used to be
[12/6/19, 8:51:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sure you do.
[12/6/19, 8:55:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: Didn‚Äôt mean to sound like an annoying mother. Sorry about that.
[12/6/19, 9:00:09 PM] Luc: You didn't!
[12/6/19, 9:00:46 PM] Luc: Probably I'm also tired walking up the stairs because I killed myself in the gym (?)
[12/6/19, 9:00:53 PM] Luc: It's unclear at this time
[12/6/19, 9:02:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: That would make sense
[12/6/19, 9:02:53 PM] Luc: _It's unclear at this time _
[12/6/19, 9:03:13 PM] Luc: One of my favorite things to say which I don't think anyone even realizes is a joke except perhaps Will
[12/6/19, 9:03:46 PM] Luc: You basically say something very logical and obvious, and then you back away from it very academically by saying "it's unclear at this time"
[12/6/19, 9:04:07 PM] Luc: I don't know why but it gets me every time
[12/6/19, 9:04:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/6/19, 9:04:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, I didn‚Äôt get it. Must admit.
[12/6/19, 9:08:01 PM] Luc: I could forgive you, it wasn't yo be gotten
[12/6/19, 9:08:15 PM] Luc: But you might hear me say it a lot and now you'll know that it's pure sarcasm
[12/6/19, 9:09:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Haha I‚Äôll pay attention
[12/6/19, 10:15:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm heading to bed as we speak.
[12/6/19, 10:15:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hope you have a nice night and you get some good rest. (:
[12/6/19, 10:15:53 PM] Luc: Already?
[12/6/19, 10:15:55 PM] Luc: Wow
[12/6/19, 10:16:04 PM] Luc: Everything alright Ani?
[12/6/19, 10:20:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, I just don‚Äôt feel like studying tonight. I‚Äôd rather wake up early tomorrow morning.
[12/6/19, 10:20:26 PM] Luc: So stay up late and chat with me instead?
[12/6/19, 10:20:34 PM] Luc: Haha I'm kidding I'll let you rest
[12/6/19, 10:20:38 PM] Luc: But I'm here
[12/6/19, 10:20:48 PM] Luc: With my WhatsApp open in a separate tab
[12/6/19, 10:20:58 PM] Luc: Building charts because it calms me üò∂
[12/6/19, 10:23:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt get much sleep last night, I totally would otherwise.
[12/6/19, 10:23:19 PM] Luc: I gotcha
[12/6/19, 10:24:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry. It must have been torture to talk to me today. All I‚Äôve done is complaining. I don‚Äôt like that.
[12/6/19, 10:24:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll let you enjoy your charts haha
[12/6/19, 10:25:00 PM] Luc: Talking to you is the opposite of torture
[12/6/19, 10:25:05 PM] Luc: But you had a fuuuullll day
[12/6/19, 10:25:12 PM] Luc: So you're entitled to a bit of complaint
[12/6/19, 10:25:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah. But without sharing it haha.
[12/6/19, 10:26:46 PM] Luc: Keep a journal of all the times your boss was a jerk and when you leave the company "accidentally" leave it laying around ?
[12/6/19, 10:28:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha when I leave the company I‚Äôll probably say to her face that it was because of her. As all the previous Anis should have done and didn‚Äôt do. üòÖ
[12/6/19, 10:29:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Maybe that way she understands that she keeps losing assistants cause she has these awful manners that make people feel like crap.
[12/6/19, 10:29:34 PM] Luc: This is the worst really
[12/6/19, 10:29:41 PM] Luc: Having a bad manager can just ruin your life
[12/6/19, 10:30:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: But for the time being I‚Äôll just keep trying to find ways to put up with her. I actually like the company, a lot.
[12/6/19, 10:30:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Anyhow
[12/6/19, 10:31:47 PM] Luc: Anyhow me dice
[12/6/19, 10:32:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Haha I was just going to say that she is not worth the time.
[12/6/19, 10:32:33 PM] Luc: So Sunday will you be able to liberate yourself, do you want to play it by ear?
[12/6/19, 10:34:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: My parents are leaving to Carilo for the weekend. So my plans aren‚Äôt a thing anymore.
[12/6/19, 10:34:21 PM] Luc: #ditched
[12/6/19, 10:34:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh yes. My sister invited me to lunch, but it‚Äôll depend on how much I get to study tomorrow morning.
[12/6/19, 10:34:57 PM] Luc: So is this a yes?
[12/6/19, 10:34:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: So, yes, I‚Äôll probably be able to liberate myself.
[12/6/19, 10:35:02 PM] Luc: Aha
[12/6/19, 10:35:05 PM] Luc: I wasn't sure if it was a
[12/6/19, 10:35:18 PM] Luc: Yes I'm free but I'm going to say no to punish you
[12/6/19, 10:35:32 PM] Luc: You don't seem that diabolical
[12/6/19, 10:37:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha I have no reason to punish you.
[12/6/19, 10:38:25 PM] Luc: That's a scary answer

[12/6/19, 10:47:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Have a good night üòò
[12/6/19, 10:47:09 PM] Luc: You sure? I could bore you with some radial charts
[12/6/19, 10:47:24 PM] Luc: Well if I could ever get the to FUCKING WORK

[12/7/19, 1:19:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Creo que no te mostr√© esto ayer. Entre otras cosas, ayer se sorteaba un √°rbol de navidad en la fiesta. Y quer√≠an tenerlo armado ah√≠..
[12/7/19, 1:19:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ya sabemos que Christmas freak se ofreci√≥ a hacerlo, no?

[12/7/19, 1:23:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero me encanta
[12/7/19, 1:23:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: No se si te cont√© esto, pero de chica iba al local (para el que ahora trabajo) a comprar los adornos, y cuando armaba mi √°rbol dec√≠a que compet√≠a con los de ellos. Ahora arm√© uno para ellos.
[12/7/19, 1:23:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es como llegar a Broadway de los √°rboles navide√±os
[12/7/19, 1:23:59 PM] Luc: Espero este a√±o poder armar un √°rbol con mi mam√°
[12/7/19, 1:24:46 PM] Luc: Me encanta la inspiraci√≥n pero no s√© si la met√°fora es apta hahaha

[12/7/19, 2:36:40 PM] Luc: unos ejemplos de modelos "basicos" que aumentan nuestras capacidades

[12/7/19, 2:49:43 PM] Luc: layman
[12/7/19, 2:50:24 PM] Luc: tiene que ver con la conversaci√≥n que tuvimos en uptown
[12/7/19, 2:51:35 PM] Luc: usando captchas para ense√±ar un modelo a poder leer texto, ahora con lo mismo generamos modelos para generar texto
[12/7/19, 2:52:25 PM] Luc: y es impresionante porque un "glyph" (una letra) tiene 64^2 = 4096 "variables"
[12/7/19, 2:52:38 PM] Luc: el modelo reducela a 40
[12/7/19, 2:52:54 PM] Luc: y con solamente 40 se puede generar algo muy le√≠ble
[12/7/19, 2:53:05 PM] Luc: (menos los Q que faltan la parte abajo)
[12/7/19, 2:53:14 PM] Luc: las Q

[12/7/19, 2:57:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es muy dif√≠cil leer el art√≠culo en el colectivo (principalmente porque tengo que estar atenta todo el tiempo a que no me lo arrebaten ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ). Pero dsp lo leo con m√°s tranquilidad, promise.
[12/7/19, 2:58:09 PM] Luc: No no
[12/7/19, 2:58:21 PM] Luc: Mejor verlo en tu compu luego

[12/8/19, 1:39:43 AM] Anita Zuddio: üòÅ
[12/8/19, 1:39:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: How was the after?
‚Äé[12/8/19, 2:26:24 AM] Luc: ‚Äéaudio omitted
[12/8/19, 2:36:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: Well, I‚Äôm glad you got to catch up ‚ò∫
[12/8/19, 2:37:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: Let me know when you‚Äôve made it home.
[12/8/19, 2:38:47 AM] Luc: Almost there but don't worry about me
[12/8/19, 2:38:54 AM] Luc: I run fast when in danger
[12/8/19, 2:53:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha good
[12/8/19, 2:55:34 AM] Luc: Home!
[12/8/19, 3:12:42 AM] Anita Zuddio: Awesome üòÅ
[12/8/19, 3:13:04 AM] Luc: Yourself?
[12/8/19, 3:13:21 AM] Anita Zuddio: Just ordered an Uber
[12/8/19, 3:13:54 AM] Luc: :)
[12/8/19, 3:13:57 AM] Luc: Enjoyed?
[12/8/19, 3:14:02 AM] Luc: The party y tal
[12/8/19, 3:24:35 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, I really needed it.
[12/8/19, 3:24:42 AM] Luc: Yeah?
[12/8/19, 3:27:23 AM] Luc: Writing a little novel
[12/8/19, 3:27:27 AM] Luc: üòõ
[12/8/19, 3:28:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yes. I was feeling kinda weird. I had this long long talk in the course about it. And this time off just drinking and chatting with my friends was just what I needed.
[12/8/19, 3:28:30 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry haha
[12/8/19, 3:28:59 AM] Luc: About something in particular?
[12/8/19, 3:34:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: It was trigger by what I told you about my boss yesterday. But it goes deeper. How my own insecurities allow her to get to me  more than it should. Which is sth that I need to work on, not only workwise.
[12/8/19, 3:34:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ok. This clearly isn‚Äôt sth to talk about on a Saturday night.
[12/8/19, 3:34:34 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sorry about that
[12/8/19, 3:34:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: *triggered
[12/8/19, 3:35:02 AM] Luc: It's odd to me that the only two words you abbreviate are something and somebody üò∂
[12/8/19, 3:35:09 AM] Luc: Hahaha
[12/8/19, 3:35:29 AM] Luc: Was there something specific she said or did that stuck with you?
[12/8/19, 3:36:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[12/8/19, 3:37:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: I never thought about it. I guess I got used to doing that when taking notes for consecutive interpreting.
[12/8/19, 3:38:54 AM] Luc: Just that I never see them abbreviated in conversation. Like u, idk, lol, omg, I see those all the time but somehow never sth or sb
[12/8/19, 3:39:12 AM] Luc: Which I don't understand really cause they seem apt for abbreviation
[12/8/19, 3:40:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs true. And I don‚Äôt use all the others much.
[12/8/19, 3:40:21 AM] Luc: ?
[12/8/19, 3:40:36 AM] Luc: I think it's a perfect Saturday night conversation
[12/8/19, 3:40:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: It wasn‚Äôt something specific she said but how she‚Äôs never satisfied with what I do. I‚Äôm _always_ missing something.
[12/8/19, 3:41:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll take that cause it‚Äôs a long way home haha.
[12/8/19, 3:42:00 AM] Luc: I wonder if this is something I do too
[12/8/19, 3:42:18 AM] Luc: I wonder more than that if the doer can also be cognizant of the doing
[12/8/19, 3:43:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: You mean that she is not aware of what she does?
[12/8/19, 3:44:59 AM] Luc: Possibly
[12/8/19, 3:46:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm pretty sure that she is. A few days ago she told me that I should leave copies of my expenses on the trip to Formosa in case I‚Äôm not there any more next year, ‚Äúcause she is already used to people leaving‚Äù.
[12/8/19, 3:46:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ok.
[12/8/19, 3:46:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: What I just said proves what you were saying
[12/8/19, 3:46:41 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve just realized it
[12/8/19, 3:46:52 AM] Luc: üò∂
[12/8/19, 3:48:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[12/8/19, 3:50:50 AM] Luc: Maybe she grew up with a parent(s) who modeled a similar pattern of behavior
[12/8/19, 3:51:03 AM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs possible
[12/8/19, 3:51:26 AM] Luc: Maybe she hasn't had an opportunity to see what a healthy relationship of boss/employee should look like
[12/8/19, 3:51:35 AM] Luc: From the perspective of the boss
[12/8/19, 3:51:43 AM] Luc: I mean, the possibilities are numerous
[12/8/19, 3:52:03 AM] Luc: And you don't really have to _take responsibility_ for her insensitivity
[12/8/19, 3:52:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Absolutely
[12/8/19, 3:52:12 AM] Luc: But you do have to take responsibility for how it makes you feel
[12/8/19, 3:52:50 AM] Anita Zuddio: What we were talking was how she touches my own weak point.
[12/8/19, 3:53:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: What we were talking today at the course, I skipped half of the information haha.
[12/8/19, 3:55:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm having a really hard time to put it into words. I‚Äôm sorry.
[12/8/19, 3:56:41 AM] Luc: You could write it in Spanish if you prefer
[12/8/19, 3:57:20 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha no, it‚Äôs not a matter of languages. I just suck when it comes to talking about myself.
[12/8/19, 3:59:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: The thing is that she has questioned many things about my personality directly (like the tone of my voice and how my shyness doesn‚Äôt give a good image... whatever). And at the same time (and here is the key part) she is always dissatisfied, which frustrates me more than it should because of my self-demanding personality.
[12/8/19, 4:01:04 AM] Luc: I see
[12/8/19, 4:01:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: So the combo is really bad.  It stresses/upsets me a lot.
[12/8/19, 4:01:33 AM] Luc: I think the part of critiquing personality traits has no place in the workplace
[12/8/19, 4:02:10 AM] Luc: I think that's representative of a bad manager, or more generally someone who doesn't understand well a certain level of social decorum
[12/8/19, 4:02:58 AM] Luc: The key part you mention may be something you could grow out of on your own, I mean, it seems independent of her actions
[12/8/19, 4:05:00 AM] Luc: Welcome home
[12/8/19, 4:08:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. Just made it home haha.
[12/8/19, 4:10:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: Exactly. That‚Äôs the part I was saying I need to improve. In every aspect.
[12/8/19, 4:11:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: I mean, not only with work or school. But with my personal life as well.
[12/8/19, 4:12:24 AM] Anita Zuddio: But I should start with my job probably haha. Baby steps.
[12/8/19, 4:13:19 AM] Luc: Yeah
[12/8/19, 4:13:32 AM] Luc: It's a frustration I don't miss
[12/8/19, 4:15:07 AM] Luc: I'm sorry you're dealing with all of that
[12/8/19, 4:15:56 AM] Luc: I think generally it's better to try to understand than to be upset although it take a quite a lot more effort
[12/8/19, 4:16:27 AM] Luc: My dad is _very_ demanding and difficult so I've sort of grown up with that presence
[12/8/19, 4:16:44 AM] Luc: It used to upset me but now more than that I just worry about him
[12/8/19, 4:18:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: Absolutely.
[12/8/19, 4:22:04 AM] Anita Zuddio: I guess I have the luck of having my Saturday ‚Äúclasses‚Äù. It‚Äôs really therapeutical in that sense. We talk a lot about what‚Äôs going on in our lives, how it affects us and how we are tackling it.
[12/8/19, 4:25:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm so sorry I‚Äôm making you put up with all this!
[12/8/19, 4:27:18 AM] Luc: Don't be sorry
[12/8/19, 4:27:22 AM] Luc: Thank you for sharing
[12/8/19, 4:27:33 AM] Luc: We can continue tonight
[12/8/19, 4:27:39 AM] Luc: I need to zzz
[12/8/19, 4:27:41 AM] Luc: üòò
[12/8/19, 4:28:21 AM] Anita Zuddio: I think we can enjoy ourselves and our milanesas tonight. üòä
[12/8/19, 4:28:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sleep well!

[12/8/19, 12:25:06 PM] Luc: I have provenzal y ajo y perejil
[12/8/19, 12:25:29 PM] Luc: We can make the mix? Then I'll have it? Haha

[12/8/19, 12:28:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: and lemon
[12/8/19, 12:29:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm missing the wine cause I get the good ones at the chino, not the supermarket.
[12/8/19, 12:30:08 PM] Luc: Worry not
[12/8/19, 12:30:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I think we aren‚Äôt missing anything. Let me know if you need me to take anything else for the side dish.
[12/8/19, 12:30:51 PM] Luc: Pur√© rustica te pinta?
[12/8/19, 12:31:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll never say no to milanesas con pur√©.

[12/8/19, 12:32:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: The sweetest thing I‚Äôve ever been told.
[12/8/19, 12:32:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: I won‚Äôt bother any longer, enjoy lunch with your friends! (:
[12/8/19, 3:51:34 PM] Luc: Could we say 7:30 just to be safe?
[12/8/19, 3:51:46 PM] Luc: I'm just getting home and I'd still like to do my walk/shopping/tidying
[12/8/19, 3:53:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sure!
[12/8/19, 3:54:02 PM] Luc: How's the studying?
[12/8/19, 3:54:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: Just let me know when you‚Äôve made it home and I calculate from there.
[12/8/19, 3:54:26 PM] Luc: okay!
[12/8/19, 3:55:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: My friend is missing in action. I actually checked my phone cause I though it would be her. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[12/8/19, 3:55:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I actually enjoy what I‚Äôm studying right now so it‚Äôs not bad at all.

[12/8/19, 3:55:39 PM] Luc: the province is a dangerous place

[12/9/19, 1:29:53 PM] Luc: a mi mam√° no le gustar√≠a
[12/9/19, 1:30:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Un what?
[12/9/19, 1:30:07 PM] Luc: tiene una letra lindisima
[12/9/19, 1:30:40 PM] Luc: o sea, _italics_ se inclinan a la derecha
[12/9/19, 1:30:48 PM] Luc: las letras tuyas, a la izquierda
[12/9/19, 1:31:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: No lo llego a detectar. Las veo bastante ‚Äúderechas‚Äù (sin inclinaci√≥n).
[12/9/19, 1:31:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: se supone que no est√° bien tenerlo?

[12/9/19, 1:37:20 PM] Luc: la letra mia es mal√≠sima
[12/9/19, 1:37:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pero eso aplica a la imprenta tmb?
[12/9/19, 1:38:04 PM] Luc: hay pocas fuentes con backslant
[12/9/19, 1:38:15 PM] Luc: unas estilizadas para ser as√≠ pero no es tan comun
[12/9/19, 1:39:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Claro
[12/9/19, 1:39:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: No te creo jaja
[12/9/19, 1:40:05 PM] Luc: no tengo eje
[12/9/19, 1:40:16 PM] Luc: mi firma esta bien, normal
[12/9/19, 1:41:00 PM] Luc: pero si estoy tomando notas (y no suelo hacer eso) es bastante chota
[12/9/19, 1:41:10 PM] Luc: ni es cursiva
[12/9/19, 1:41:16 PM] Luc: no fui a escuela anita
[12/9/19, 1:41:43 PM] Luc: cuando todos aprendian como escribir yo estaba en mi jardin
[12/9/19, 1:42:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Excuses. Hay gente que fue y tiene una letra horrible. Y viceversa.
[12/9/19, 1:42:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajaja
[12/9/19, 1:42:36 PM] Luc: no me importa tanto
[12/9/19, 1:42:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Lo importante era el contend√≠ del texto, no la letra üò™

[12/9/19, 3:47:52 PM] Luc: Bue
[12/9/19, 3:48:13 PM] Luc: Es m√°s de 13% menos larga
[12/9/19, 3:48:28 PM] Luc: O tambi√©n podes decir que la otra es m√°s de 15% m√°s larga
[12/9/19, 3:48:37 PM] Luc: Pero no se nota visualmente
[12/9/19, 3:50:18 PM] Luc: Pero posta
[12/9/19, 3:50:32 PM] Luc: Y te juro que el tema est√° relacionado con lo que hablamos ayer
[12/9/19, 3:50:37 PM] Luc: De la traducci√≥n
[12/9/19, 3:50:57 PM] Luc: lo que te mande fue una captura de google maps
[12/9/19, 3:51:15 PM] Luc: google maps usa una proyeccion que se llama Mercator
[12/9/19, 3:54:20 PM] Luc: hay varias proyecciones que uno puede usar para transformar algo como la Tierra (casi esferico, pero no esferico, tecnicamente una esfera achatado en los polos) en algo plano como un mapa
[12/9/19, 3:55:39 PM] Luc: y cada una de las proyecciones tiene sus pros y contras
[12/9/19, 3:56:22 PM] Luc: as√≠, eligiendo una proyecci√≥n tenes que decidir lo que queres destacar y lo que queres sacrificar en terminos de exactitud
[12/9/19, 3:56:32 PM] Luc: parecido al proceso de traducir un texto, no?
‚Äé[12/9/19, 3:58:28 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[12/9/19, 3:59:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ok. En mi croquis precario parecia mucho menos jaja.
[12/9/19, 4:00:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es subtitulado. Totalmente.
[12/9/19, 4:02:40 PM] Luc: y una de las cosas que discutimos _mucho_ cuando trabajaba en SF fue cuales proyecciones queriamos "disponibilizar" para los usuarios
[12/9/19, 4:03:35 PM] Luc: <english>
[12/9/19, 4:05:05 PM] Luc: it happens that mercator is a cylindrical projection, so things closer to the equator are relatively more accurate than things closer to the poles. as such, since these city pairs we are examining lie almost equidistant from the equator this map projection doesn't _really_ distort our perception too much. but that's essentially a happy coincidence, and this is _not_ the best projection to try to visually understand this relationship of distances
[12/9/19, 4:05:08 PM] Luc: </english>
[12/9/19, 4:25:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ser√≠a bueno ir advirti√©ndote que me vas a odiar un mont√≥n.

[12/9/19, 4:26:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Y yo tengo tan poco para aportar de regreso üò™)
[12/9/19, 4:28:28 PM] Luc: por?
[12/9/19, 4:35:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: Porque te hago explicarme 1 de cada 2 cosas que dec√≠s
[12/9/19, 4:43:29 PM] Luc: son cosas de math y tal

[12/9/19, 6:15:58 PM] Luc: Muy raro pero todo el d√≠a me duele mal el hombro
[12/9/19, 6:16:55 PM] Luc: Que hice ayer que duela hoy?
[12/9/19, 6:17:03 PM] Luc: Como se escribe esto?
[12/9/19, 6:17:15 PM] Luc: "what did I do yesterday that it would hurt today?"
[12/9/19, 6:20:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que pude haber hecho ayer que me duele hoy?
[12/9/19, 6:22:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: O.. que pude haber hecho ayer para que me duela hoy? Esa ser√≠a la m√°s linda.

[12/9/19, 7:49:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Me puse a leer esto con tranquilidad. Sabemos de cu√°ndo es esa descripci√≥n? Porque el hobo-dyer es una descripci√≥n bastante accurate de un gran sector (nefasto) de los argentinos hoy. Con lenguaje inclusivo y todo!

[12/9/19, 11:45:09 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm es dif√≠cil decir. Porque tenia uno que funciona muy bien, tiene muchos a√±os y no perdi√≥ el filo, pero este es m√°s maniobrable creo.
[12/9/19, 11:45:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Anyways..
[12/9/19, 11:45:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: No fue una compra al pedo finalmente. Quer√≠a decirte eso. ‚ò∫
[12/9/19, 11:46:03 PM] Luc: Vos no tenia uno?
[12/9/19, 11:46:11 PM] Luc: Nvm haha
[12/9/19, 11:46:24 PM] Luc: üòò
[12/9/19, 11:46:31 PM] Luc: Mimos
[12/9/19, 11:48:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Qu√© tal tu noche?
‚Äé[12/9/19, 11:51:55 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[12/9/19, 11:55:38 PM] Anita Zuddio: Cuantas flechas jajaja
[12/9/19, 11:55:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: Es todo lo que llego a ver
[12/10/19, 12:03:21 AM] Luc: It's very inspiring to see some of the ways people choose to represent information
[12/10/19, 12:03:42 AM] Luc: I would bring back coffee table books but I'm afraid of being judged
‚Äé[12/10/19, 12:08:07 AM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[12/10/19, 12:08:31 AM] Luc: once you understand the chart you can tell the lines which are steeper, ie. more inclined, are trains which move faster
[12/10/19, 12:08:58 AM] Luc: looks like an absolute mess but really is quite an interesting method
[12/10/19, 12:10:02 AM] Luc: do you remember when I was just nice and normal with you? and we just talked about nice, normal things?
[12/10/19, 12:10:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: Why would anyone judge you? haha
[12/10/19, 12:10:54 AM] Anita Zuddio: Did we ever?
[12/10/19, 12:11:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: ü§î
[12/10/19, 12:11:24 AM] Luc: yes we totally did
[12/10/19, 12:12:04 AM] Luc: i don't really talk to _any_ of my friends about what i do, they know i work "with computers" (lol)
[12/10/19, 12:12:12 AM] Luc: partially i have no idea how to explain in spanish
[12/10/19, 12:12:30 AM] Luc: most people who ask i will just tell them "i help clients to implement business software"
[12/10/19, 12:12:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: This is incredible
[12/10/19, 12:12:42 AM] Luc: right?!
[12/10/19, 12:12:57 AM] Anita Zuddio: AKA you work with computers
[12/10/19, 12:13:00 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/10/19, 12:15:00 AM] Luc: yeah exactly
[12/10/19, 12:15:13 AM] Luc: and then they say "but why did you study economics"
[12/10/19, 12:15:19 AM] Luc: and I say "oh it's not related"
[12/10/19, 12:15:37 AM] Luc: but it's kinda very related
[12/10/19, 12:16:07 AM] Luc: ANYWAY how was your day
[12/10/19, 12:16:11 AM] Luc: let's have a nice normal conversation
[12/10/19, 12:16:48 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/10/19, 12:17:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: It was good!
[12/10/19, 12:17:52 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm just worried cause I‚Äôm not being able to concentrate as much as I‚Äôd like to. But I got to learn quite a few things about torts today, not that bad.
[12/10/19, 12:18:52 AM] Anita Zuddio: I had to take two short naps tho, I couldn‚Äôt stay awake. Then I cooked for the week and now I‚Äôm reading my notes in bed.
[12/10/19, 12:19:20 AM] Luc: oh I love a good tort
[12/10/19, 12:19:36 AM] Luc: chocolate torts especially
[12/10/19, 12:20:02 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/10/19, 12:20:18 AM] Anita Zuddio: I wish there were chocolate ones
[12/10/19, 12:21:30 AM] Luc: you could
[12/10/19, 12:21:32 AM] Luc: theoretically
[12/10/19, 12:21:35 AM] Luc: carve words into the chocolate
[12/10/19, 12:21:35 AM] Luc: ?
[12/10/19, 12:22:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: Okay. You‚Äôve lost me there.
[12/10/19, 12:22:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: What would that have to do with torts?
[12/10/19, 12:23:25 AM] Luc: i thought they had to do with breaching contracts
[12/10/19, 12:23:32 AM] Luc: so maybe you could write a contract on a large slab of chocolate
[12/10/19, 12:23:34 AM] Luc: and then break it
[12/10/19, 12:23:37 AM] Luc: to represent a tort
[12/10/19, 12:23:43 AM] Luc: I don't know, I'm just brainstorming here
[12/10/19, 12:23:47 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[12/10/19, 12:24:20 AM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs the opposite actually. A tort is any wrong-doing that isn‚Äôt a breach of contract.
[12/10/19, 12:24:51 AM] Luc: so maybe the chocolate melts
[12/10/19, 12:25:16 AM] Luc: you criticize me for remembering things but this is _the_ way to do it
[12/10/19, 12:25:40 AM] Luc: put them in ludicrous terms so they occupy a network of unexpected connections in your brain
[12/10/19, 12:25:52 AM] Luc: now every time you think of torts you'll think of chocolate
[12/10/19, 12:25:49 AM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt criticize you! It‚Äôs pure envy hahaha.
[12/10/19, 12:26:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: That‚Äôs not a good plan. At all.
[12/10/19, 12:26:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: üòÖ
[12/10/19, 12:27:33 AM] Luc: it's a superb plan
[12/10/19, 12:27:40 AM] Luc: I went to villa crespo the other day
[12/10/19, 12:27:52 AM] Luc: to vera, to get those little planter things
[12/10/19, 12:28:06 AM] Luc: i picked them up and walked towards cordoba
[12/10/19, 12:28:36 AM] Luc: corrientes, vera, velasco, aguirre, loyola, castillo, jufre, lerma, cordoba
[12/10/19, 12:28:46 AM] Luc: how?
[12/10/19, 12:28:48 AM] Luc: corrientes is a river
[12/10/19, 12:28:52 AM] Luc: vera is an old lady
[12/10/19, 12:29:00 AM] Luc: velasco is this conquistador type
[12/10/19, 12:29:07 AM] Luc: aguirre is like an eagle who swoops by
[12/10/19, 12:29:22 AM] Luc: loyola is my friend time who went to loyola high school in los angeles and always wore than sweatshirt in college
[12/10/19, 12:29:26 AM] Luc: castillo is a castle
[12/10/19, 12:29:32 AM] Luc: jufre is a jew (lol i got lazy)
[12/10/19, 12:29:43 AM] Luc: lerma i just remember cause there's a chino there where i shopped once
[12/10/19, 12:29:49 AM] Luc: cordoba is cordoba i already know that one
[12/10/19, 12:29:52 AM] Luc: ez pz
[12/10/19, 12:30:02 AM] Luc: this is why i asked you _what does studying mean_
[12/10/19, 12:30:14 AM] Luc: because the human brain is narrative by nature
[12/10/19, 12:30:20 AM] Luc: i wanted to know what your narration is like
[12/10/19, 12:30:46 AM] Anita Zuddio: And the answer probably was ‚Äúpoor, very poor‚Äù.
[12/10/19, 12:31:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: We are thought that method when they train our memory for consecutive translation without note taking.
[12/10/19, 12:32:25 AM] Anita Zuddio: *taught (please ignore that)
[12/10/19, 12:32:53 AM] Luc: the principle is more important than the method, i'd say
[12/10/19, 12:33:07 AM] Luc: the _unexpected_ is memorable
[12/10/19, 12:33:13 AM] Luc: so you must manufacture the unexpected
[12/10/19, 12:33:57 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yes, you are right.
[12/10/19, 12:35:37 AM] Anita Zuddio: You should know that our English days are being REALLY helpful. Words come much easier when you keep the language this active.
[12/10/19, 12:36:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: So thank you for that
[12/10/19, 12:37:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: (Although our talks must probably frustrate you a little bit, I imagine)
[12/10/19, 12:37:46 AM] Luc: Zero
[12/10/19, 12:41:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: Haha ok, let‚Äôs say I believe that.
[12/10/19, 12:42:57 AM] Luc: why would you not?
[12/10/19, 12:43:18 AM] Luc: I've lived here more than two years and been relatively unable to express myself to talk about certain subjects which really interest me
[12/10/19, 12:49:15 AM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, but I just don‚Äôt have the.. level of knowledge, shall we say, necessary to keep it interesting. And the few times I do, I‚Äôm just not good enough putting it into words. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
[12/10/19, 12:52:28 AM] Luc: i think you're assigning yourself a role which isn't necessary
[12/10/19, 12:52:45 AM] Luc: if you don't have something to share regarding a particular topic i really don't hold it against you
[12/10/19, 12:52:55 AM] Luc: there are _many_ things I know nothing about what you know a great deal about
[12/10/19, 12:54:34 AM] Anita Zuddio: Oh no, I know you don‚Äôt. I just wish I _did_ have sth to share. üòÖ
[12/10/19, 12:56:40 AM] Luc: it's not even something i thought about until you brought it up
[12/10/19, 12:56:46 AM] Luc: i appreciate that you listen to me
[12/10/19, 1:10:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: Until I fall asleep just in the middle of out conversation haha
[12/10/19, 1:13:41 AM] Luc: Hahahaha
[12/10/19, 1:13:45 AM] Luc: Well yes there's that

[12/10/19, 1:19:08 AM] Anita Zuddio: ‚ò∫üòç
[12/10/19, 1:19:40 AM] Luc: ear game very strong
[12/10/19, 1:30:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: hahaha
[12/10/19, 1:31:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: Still so very cute
[12/10/19, 1:33:05 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sir, I‚Äôll head to bed now. Talk to you tomorrow.
[12/10/19, 1:33:14 AM] Anita Zuddio: ‚ÄéThis message was deleted.

[12/10/19, 1:36:25 AM] Luc: Okay üòò
[12/10/19, 1:36:29 AM] Luc: Night!
[12/10/19, 8:22:53 AM] Anita Zuddio: So I woke up to this and I think it‚Äôs only fair that you get one as well.

[12/10/19, 2:35:57 PM] Luc: hey there
[12/10/19, 2:36:04 PM] Luc: sorry, woke up to some emails and have been very busy
[12/10/19, 2:36:29 PM] Luc: now I look up and it's 37 outside and I need to go buy more cuadril and get my oven roasting. starting to regret my decision. maybe I just make a big salad
[12/10/19, 2:38:03 PM] Luc: you look like you just finished eating another human üôä
[12/10/19, 2:45:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hey! No worries.
[12/10/19, 2:45:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: That doesn‚Äôt sound good at all.
[12/10/19, 2:45:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ice cream for dinner would be a good option today
[12/10/19, 2:45:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I really don‚Äôt know how to answer to that.
[12/10/19, 2:46:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: I used to think it was a cute photo... now I‚Äôm not so sure.
[12/10/19, 2:48:26 PM] Luc: hahahah it's cute
[12/10/19, 2:48:32 PM] Luc: like an advertisement for Cannibals-R-Us
[12/10/19, 2:48:55 PM] Luc: You're more salvaje than Dia's current round of Ofertas
[12/10/19, 3:00:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[12/10/19, 6:19:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Did you do your shopping after all?
[12/10/19, 6:19:37 PM] Luc: I did!
[12/10/19, 6:19:43 PM] Luc: And I didn't break a sweat
[12/10/19, 6:19:49 PM] Luc: How is that even possible?
[12/10/19, 6:19:55 PM] Luc: I dunno, I guess it's a pretty dry heat
[12/10/19, 6:20:01 PM] Luc: and I went in flip-flops and shorts haha
[12/10/19, 6:30:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/10/19, 6:30:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm glad! (:
[12/10/19, 6:31:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Are u cooking already? I don‚Äôt wanna interrupt any podcast.
[12/10/19, 11:12:00 PM] Luc: Hey there
[12/10/19, 11:12:08 PM] Luc: Sorry! They just left
[12/10/19, 11:12:41 PM] Luc: Anita had some early meeting tomorrow so she wanted to do an early dinner, the came at like 7:30 and I started cooking
[12/10/19, 11:28:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hey!
[12/10/19, 11:28:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: How did that cuadril go?
[12/10/19, 11:28:43 PM] Luc: I didn't make it!
[12/10/19, 11:28:59 PM] Luc: I made a salad with chicken
[12/10/19, 11:30:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Probably a better idea with this temperature.
[12/10/19, 11:30:19 PM] Luc: Oh you mean

[12/10/19, 11:31:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/10/19, 11:31:41 PM] Luc: The _fun_ never ends
[12/10/19, 11:31:50 PM] Luc: Fyi
[12/10/19, 11:32:01 PM] Luc: For dessert we had that Sirius
[12/10/19, 11:32:05 PM] Luc: With strawberries
[12/10/19, 11:32:07 PM] Luc: Very delicious
[12/10/19, 11:32:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Were you _over the moon_?
[12/10/19, 11:33:23 PM] Luc: Lol
[12/10/19, 11:33:24 PM] Luc: Nice
[12/10/19, 11:33:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: It was the only space related thing I could come up with haha
[12/10/19, 11:34:14 PM] Luc: I appreciated it
[12/10/19, 11:34:25 PM] Luc: How has your afternoon and night been?
[12/10/19, 11:37:24 PM] Anita Zuddio: Good. My mom stopped by, we had some mates. Then I took a nap cause I was getting a headache and I didn‚Äôt want it to get too bad (this sounds like the worst excuse ever, I know). And I‚Äôve been studying since. That‚Äôs pretty much it.
[12/10/19, 11:37:31 PM] Luc: Have*
[12/10/19, 11:37:50 PM] Luc: Sounds peaceful
[12/10/19, 11:39:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah, the first days of really bad heat usually have me like low bat. I‚Äôm already in bed actually, I‚Äôll try to study before work tomorrow.
[12/10/19, 11:39:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: *try*
[12/10/19, 11:40:24 PM] Luc: I dont know how you do this
[12/10/19, 11:40:32 PM] Luc: Have the motivation
[12/10/19, 11:41:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Panic driven
[12/10/19, 11:41:33 PM] Luc: But such panic in advance
[12/10/19, 11:42:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: I guess it hit early this time cause they are the very last exams.
[12/10/19, 11:45:56 PM] Luc: I'd wait until the day of
[12/10/19, 11:46:08 PM] Luc: And then id realize like I always do
[12/10/19, 11:46:14 PM] Luc: That I don't understand how to study
[12/10/19, 11:46:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: But you do.. ü§î
[12/10/19, 11:47:07 PM] Luc: I do what?
[12/10/19, 11:47:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: Understand how to study
[12/10/19, 11:47:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well, I haven‚Äôt seen Luc as a student.
[12/10/19, 11:48:09 PM] Luc: Not really. I didn't and I don't
[12/10/19, 11:48:28 PM] Luc: And it's always something that has made me feel shitty as a person
[12/10/19, 11:51:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: You shouldn‚Äôt. There isn‚Äôt _a_ way of studying. And you have acquired all the things you know somehow.
[12/10/19, 11:53:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: I mean, even what you told me yesterday about how you remember street names could be considered a way of studying at some level.
[12/10/19, 11:54:06 PM] Luc: You have no way of quantifying all of the things I may have forgotten
[12/10/19, 11:55:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: But I don‚Äôt think that one thing necessarily has to do with the other.
[12/11/19, 12:03:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: It may help.. knowing which is the ‚Äúmost efficient technique‚Äù for you to get the concepts. But then you may also have a shitty memory (like me), that doesn‚Äôt help.
[12/11/19, 12:04:32 AM] Anita Zuddio: What I mean is that I don‚Äôt associate forgetting things you have once learnt with being bad at studying them.
[12/11/19, 12:05:56 AM] Luc: I had and still have the sensation that everything I "learned" in school was mostly a huge waste of time
[12/11/19, 12:06:17 AM] Luc: Which I realize sounds like a very antisocial viewpoint
[12/11/19, 12:06:59 AM] Luc: Period end of thought
[12/11/19, 12:07:57 AM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajaja
[12/11/19, 12:08:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: En eso estoy de acuerdo
[12/11/19, 12:13:01 AM] Anita Zuddio: Cambio radicalmente de tema, pero el otro d√≠a hablamos de las distancias de los vuelos y no te pregunt√©, sacaste el de regreso al final?
[12/11/19, 12:13:01 AM] Luc: Ups perdon
[12/11/19, 12:13:08 AM] Luc: Ni vi "today"
[12/11/19, 12:13:22 AM] Luc: Todav√≠a no
[12/11/19, 12:13:25 AM] Luc: Sigo esperando
[12/11/19, 12:13:29 AM] Luc: Hay opciones
[12/11/19, 12:13:40 AM] Luc: Pero quiero volver en ejecutiva porque #vidacheto
[12/11/19, 12:14:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: Pens√© que era porque #tally
[12/11/19, 12:14:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: Era todo una mentira jaja
[12/11/19, 12:19:07 AM] Anita Zuddio: Creo que esa no ser√≠a una palabra, pero me entendiste.
[12/11/19, 12:19:49 AM] Luc: Hahah tally si es una palabra
[12/11/19, 12:20:06 AM] Luc: Pero es cuando contas una cantidad con l√≠neas
[12/11/19, 12:20:13 AM] Luc: Cada l√≠nea es un "tally"
[12/11/19, 12:20:24 AM] Luc: Se dice "tally up" como contar.
[12/11/19, 12:22:13 AM] Anita Zuddio: Sisi, lo asocio con votos m√°s que nada
[12/11/19, 12:22:44 AM] Anita Zuddio: Quise decir que no lo usar√≠as para hablar informalmente de alguien alto. Como si usar√≠as ‚Äúfatty‚Äù.
[12/11/19, 12:23:19 AM] Anita Zuddio: Nevermind
[12/11/19, 12:24:10 AM] Anita Zuddio: En 5 d√≠as ya viajas! Entusiasmado?
[12/11/19, 12:24:26 AM] Luc: No hahaha nunca

[12/12/19, 10:57:16 AM] Luc: Sorry about yesterday, I felt a certain level of stress and obligation to put something on my calendar
[12/12/19, 11:04:29 AM] Anita Zuddio: Nothing to apologize for
[12/12/19, 11:04:54 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm glad (:

[12/12/19, 12:52:10 PM] Luc: I'm sure there are some others
[12/12/19, 12:52:51 PM] Anita Zuddio: There must be another one close to Salgero. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the name.
[12/12/19, 12:53:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. That was the one. And I‚Äôve just found out that they sell their stuff at my bosses‚Äô Christmas shop haha.
[12/12/19, 12:54:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Not interesting at all, I‚Äôm sorry)
[12/12/19, 12:54:28 PM] Luc: Hahaha chill
[12/12/19, 12:55:01 PM] Luc: I have so much shit to do that I literally can't do anything
[12/12/19, 12:55:10 PM] Luc: Katie comes back Monday and I owe her a project
[12/12/19, 12:55:17 PM] Luc: Which i didn't even start

[12/12/19, 1:05:26 PM] Luc: Go full headphones mode
[12/12/19, 1:06:21 PM] Luc: Aggressive heavy dubstep and a stupid amount of code (but zero lyrics because _human_ sounds distract the brain)
[12/12/19, 1:06:33 PM] Luc: This should have been kicked to the uruguayos
[12/12/19, 1:06:41 PM] Luc: But I volunteered and I regret it
[12/12/19, 1:07:21 PM] Luc: Cause I've been spending the whole.week.doing stupid things (fixing not broken things) for that commercial real estate firm
[12/12/19, 1:14:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: But Katie will like you a lot (more) after this. That‚Äôs good.
[12/12/19, 1:16:32 PM] Anita Zuddio: Get some tea (cause coffee is no longer an option for Luc) and some of those cookies you got the other day. Sugar for the brain.
[12/12/19, 1:17:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh, no, wait. Mate is also an option, right? Go for mate. üôåüèº

[12/12/19, 4:45:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: But it‚Äôs a great excuse to avoid being contacted back by friends of friends who come and visit. So...
[12/12/19, 4:46:13 PM] Luc: SO

[12/12/19, 5:25:15 PM] Luc: oh que copado
[12/12/19, 5:25:19 PM] Luc: me gusta el dise√±o
[12/12/19, 5:25:26 PM] Luc: it actually came together
[12/12/19, 5:25:34 PM] Luc: I am waiting for a response from a colleague about one part
[12/12/19, 5:25:45 PM] Luc: We are trying to templatize some of this logic
[12/12/19, 5:25:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: And the drawings inside are insane
[12/12/19, 5:26:16 PM] Luc: Basically we go and scan the standard data model in your org, then beyond suggesting individual dashboards we are building entire apps
[12/12/19, 5:26:31 PM] Luc: so like, if you are tracking customer cases from email, web, phone, social media in a set of objects
[12/12/19, 5:26:42 PM] Luc: we will automatically generate for you a number of dashboards to track response times
[12/12/19, 5:26:45 PM] Luc: customer satisfaction
[12/12/19, 5:26:49 PM] Luc: net promoter scores
[12/12/19, 5:27:15 PM] Luc: it's really not all that involved. it's basically doing some simple guessing and then asking the user to confirm whether we were correct or not
[12/12/19, 5:27:21 PM] Luc: so that is something i'm working on
[12/12/19, 5:28:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: You do know that I would love to sit right next to you and watch you do all this, right? I mean, I will never, cause it must be the most distracting thing on Earth. But it would be amazing.
[12/12/19, 5:29:13 PM] Luc: yeah the thing is there isn't much to see
[12/12/19, 5:29:21 PM] Luc: the stack is enormous
[12/12/19, 5:29:33 PM] Luc: so i'm sifting through a million files to add a function here and there
[12/12/19, 5:29:40 PM] Luc: or we are like reorganizing and refactoring
[12/12/19, 5:30:11 PM] Luc: or often i'm just letting other people do this and we are just discussing how to model and display things
[12/12/19, 5:30:51 PM] Luc: there's _very little_ in this branch of computer science that hasn't been done before
[12/12/19, 5:31:07 PM] Luc: so all of the logic already exists and when we are _good_ engineers, it exists in nice little modular pieces
[12/12/19, 5:31:34 PM] Luc: so I'm just putting gears in place, gears that (almost always) someone else much smarter than I already built
[12/12/19, 5:43:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeah. Well. That didn‚Äôt deter me from wanting to see you doing what you do.

[12/12/19, 6:06:10 PM] Luc: but which applies to nostalgia
[12/12/19, 6:14:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Is it nostalgia even if one didn‚Äôt actually _live_ those days?

[12/13/19, 1:16:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajaja si, es cierto
[12/13/19, 1:19:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que tal tu d√≠a? Aparte de reci√©n comenzando..
[12/13/19, 2:29:29 PM] Luc: Bien bien
[12/13/19, 2:29:31 PM] Luc: Laburando
[12/13/19, 2:29:38 PM] Luc: Quiero entregar un par de cosas hoy
[12/13/19, 2:48:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Perdon! Te dejo hacer tranquilo
[12/13/19, 5:00:49 PM] Luc: que tal tu tarde?
[12/13/19, 5:33:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Bien!
[12/13/19, 5:33:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Sin jefes, as√≠ que tranquila
[12/13/19, 5:33:30 PM] Luc: que suerte
[12/13/19, 5:34:23 PM] Luc: me alegro :)
[12/13/19, 5:37:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚ò∫
[12/13/19, 5:38:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: Que onda tu viernes? Social? O de descanso?
[12/13/19, 5:39:59 PM] Luc: esta noche salgo
[12/13/19, 5:40:06 PM] Luc: pero la verdad no quiero
[12/13/19, 5:40:18 PM] Luc: espero animarme mas luego
[12/13/19, 5:40:21 PM] Luc: y vos?
[12/13/19, 5:41:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Te noto lo animado a la distancia
[12/13/19, 5:41:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: jajajaja
[12/13/19, 5:42:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yo salgo a cenar con amigos de la facultad.
[12/13/19, 5:42:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: Y dsp no se. Si lo dejo en manos de mi sue√±o, me vuelvo directo a casa jaja. Ver√©.
[12/13/19, 6:41:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: Tengo el feeling de que estoy molestando m√°s de lo que estoy divirtiendo (un mont√≥n m√°s) jaja. Hablamos luego si queres! O ma√±ana.. cuando sea que est√©s tranqui. (:
[12/14/19, 12:16:55 PM] Luc: Hey there
[12/14/19, 12:18:04 PM] Luc: This morning I rode the Subway home after plop and I captured this photo
‚Äé[12/14/19, 12:18:09 PM] Luc: ‚Äéimage omitted
[12/14/19, 12:18:27 PM] Luc: I believe this is how you are as well ? üòõ
[12/14/19, 1:18:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hi!
[12/14/19, 1:20:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hey! That was mean. (But yeah, it probably is üòÖ)
[12/14/19, 1:21:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Did you have a good time after all?
‚Äé[12/14/19, 1:33:37 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[12/14/19, 4:23:04 PM] Anita Zuddio: I know that I‚Äôm the anxious one here (now more than ever cause I‚Äôm suffering from _pre-exam edginess_ haha), but we are having like the least flowing conversation EVER.
[12/14/19, 4:25:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: So, I hope it‚Äôs just that you have many things to get ready/finish before leaving, but you are doing fine.
[12/14/19, 4:25:34 PM] Luc: Gah no it's that I'm totally dead today and just watching videos with this tab open I'm sorry
[12/14/19, 4:25:56 PM] Luc: I wish I was being productive
[12/14/19, 4:26:17 PM] Luc: Oh nice! Which place is this ?
[12/14/19, 4:26:40 PM] Luc: It was precisely what I needed but also I sort of regret it because Saturday has been exploded
[12/14/19, 4:28:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: No worries
[12/14/19, 4:29:25 PM] Anita Zuddio: Lucciano‚Äôs
[12/14/19, 4:29:31 PM] Luc: Ah yes!
[12/14/19, 4:29:37 PM] Luc: I'm glad hahaha
[12/14/19, 4:29:55 PM] Luc: Now to find a reason to want ice cream.. I don't know what happened
[12/14/19, 4:30:01 PM] Luc: I think basically as I've gotten older
[12/14/19, 4:30:06 PM] Luc: I've eaten less and less dairy
[12/14/19, 4:30:34 PM] Luc: Now I basically will eat cheese and butter and yogurt occasionally but even ice cream seems craaaazy rich to me
[12/14/19, 4:31:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: And you still get to break people‚Äôs legs.. your bones are GOOD.
[12/14/19, 4:32:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: üòú
[12/14/19, 4:32:39 PM] Luc: Hahaha cause when i was a pibito
[12/14/19, 4:32:44 PM] Luc: I drank a gallon of milk a day
[12/14/19, 4:32:47 PM] Luc: Not joking
[12/14/19, 4:32:51 PM] Luc: It was actually gross
[12/14/19, 4:38:51 PM] Luc: How are your studies?
[12/14/19, 4:40:15 PM] Anita Zuddio: Okay, that makes sense. You‚Äôve had enough dairy for a lifetime.
[12/14/19, 4:40:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/14/19, 4:40:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Good!
[12/14/19, 4:41:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm heading to the supermarket right now cause I have zero food in the fridge. So this is my break.
[12/14/19, 4:42:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve think I‚Äôve touched all topics now. I need to go over my glossaries. And then start reading all over again one last time.
[12/14/19, 4:42:21 PM] Luc: Oh goodnesd
[12/14/19, 4:42:35 PM] Luc: Seems rather exhausting
[12/14/19, 4:42:37 PM] Luc: :(
[12/14/19, 4:43:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: It is. But it‚Äôs my fault cause I‚Äôve been quite distracted. So now I need to cover as much as possible between today, tomorrow and Monday morning.
[12/14/19, 4:44:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: I dunno. I work better under pressure apparently.
[12/14/19, 4:44:33 PM] Luc: How was your night?
[12/14/19, 4:44:40 PM] Luc: I could understand this
[12/14/19, 4:45:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: Could? ü§î
[12/14/19, 4:46:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: Great! We had a really good time. Of course I didn‚Äôt get to do anything after dinner, as expected. I actually fell asleep on the bus.
[12/14/19, 4:46:35 PM] Anita Zuddio: Just like this
[12/14/19, 4:47:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Probably drooling as well)
[12/14/19, 4:47:56 PM] Luc: Hahahahaha
[12/14/19, 4:48:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: I want to ask how Plop was, but I don‚Äôt wanna keep interrupting your videos. Just let me know and we can talk later, or after soccer, or whenever you want haha.
[12/14/19, 4:49:22 PM] Luc: Soccer canceled :(
[12/14/19, 4:49:34 PM] Luc: Despedida later
[12/14/19, 4:51:10 PM] Luc: But we can chat :)
[12/14/19, 4:51:15 PM] Luc: Im just a little slow
[12/14/19, 4:51:21 PM] Luc: I have the sounds off
[12/14/19, 4:51:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh. Well, but you get to rest. Not that bad.
[12/14/19, 4:52:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha hangover Luc in full swing maybe?
[12/14/19, 4:52:38 PM] Luc: I have to manually check
[12/14/19, 4:52:40 PM] Luc: So I'm like
[12/14/19, 4:52:50 PM] Luc: Being a lazy boy
[12/14/19, 4:52:55 PM] Luc: Sharing memes AND disappearing
[12/14/19, 4:53:10 PM] Luc: Only responding to my sister cause she's pestering me üôä
[12/14/19, 4:56:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/14/19, 4:57:31 PM] Anita Zuddio: Which sister?
[12/14/19, 4:59:28 PM] Luc: Jess of course
[12/14/19, 4:59:34 PM] Luc: Back from her vacation
[12/14/19, 4:59:39 PM] Luc: And in Jess mode
[12/14/19, 4:59:50 PM] Luc: Which is to over plan everything
[12/14/19, 5:04:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Pictured. But they are still 4 haha.
[12/14/19, 5:05:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: Did she get the IPad?
[12/14/19, 5:19:30 PM] Luc: Oh man
[12/14/19, 5:19:35 PM] Luc: Not sure I even want to ask
[12/14/19, 5:29:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/14/19, 5:29:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: I could hear you saying that
[12/14/19, 5:30:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Are you spending Christmas together at your mom‚Äôs?
[12/14/19, 5:31:41 PM] Luc: Yeah
[12/14/19, 5:31:49 PM] Luc: But since Jess lives just across the bay it's not like a sleepover situation
[12/14/19, 5:55:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh okay. Got it.
[12/14/19, 6:00:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: We talked about it but you didn‚Äôt get to see nerd Ani with her glasses after all. Did you?
[12/14/19, 6:01:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: *glasses on
[12/14/19, 6:03:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was just cleaning them (I can‚Äôt stand fingerprints üòí) and remembered that we talked about it. And all our weird _abilities_ as well hahaha.
[12/14/19, 6:13:22 PM] Luc: I didn't!!
[12/14/19, 6:13:36 PM] Luc: I broke mine :(
[12/14/19, 6:13:45 PM] Luc: I think they were basically useless anyway but eh
[12/14/19, 6:16:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Why is that?
[12/14/19, 6:17:02 PM] Anita Zuddio: Okay. I still suck at selfies, but since I got this one for my cousin, I might as well send it to you.
‚Äé[12/14/19, 6:17:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äéimage omitted
[12/14/19, 6:19:36 PM] Anita Zuddio: We are always making fun of people who get tattoos and make them appear in every single photo, so when I got mine I kept sending her pictures where I was doing the silliest things but you could always see the tattoo.
[12/14/19, 6:19:41 PM] Luc: they were for the computer
[12/14/19, 6:19:49 PM] Luc: !!!! q facha
[12/14/19, 6:19:56 PM] Luc: hahahah now _this_ is my type of humor
[12/14/19, 6:20:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: And since I got it 4 years ago today, I sent her this one.
[12/14/19, 6:21:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha I know
[12/14/19, 6:23:53 PM] Luc: Feliz anivers√°rio!
[12/14/19, 6:24:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: But you do spend a lot of time in front of the screen. Shouldn‚Äôt you get new ones? ü§î
[12/14/19, 6:25:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha thanks?
[12/14/19, 6:25:20 PM] Luc: They don't magnify or anything
[12/14/19, 6:25:25 PM] Luc: They're just for the light
[12/14/19, 6:25:40 PM] Luc: Which I think doesn't really have a scientific basis
[12/14/19, 6:25:43 PM] Luc: Or much evidence
[12/14/19, 6:26:42 PM] Anita Zuddio: I know. But they have this reflection thing that helps... supposedly.
[12/14/19, 6:27:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: So that your eyes don‚Äôt end up so tired by the end of the day.
[12/14/19, 6:28:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told. No scientific basis whatsoever. So you may be right as well hahaha.
[12/14/19, 6:33:31 PM] Luc: Yeah
[12/14/19, 6:33:42 PM] Luc: I'll look into it in the usa
[12/14/19, 6:33:53 PM] Luc: Mostly cause I'm pretty with glasses
[12/14/19, 6:34:04 PM] Luc: The only accessory I like wearing
[12/14/19, 6:36:40 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahaha
[12/14/19, 6:37:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: I was going to say that you are pretty without glasses as well, but I think you like yourself enough already.
[12/14/19, 6:38:37 PM] Luc: Ouch
[12/14/19, 6:38:46 PM] Luc: Probably true
[12/14/19, 6:42:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahaha
[12/14/19, 6:43:12 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm reading about the Miranda rights, and where did that come from.
[12/14/19, 6:46:23 PM] Anita Zuddio: *Miranda rule
[12/14/19, 6:46:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: This guy Miranda, who had killed a girl in Arizona, wasn‚Äôt read his constitutional rights when arrested. So his confession was inadmissible and he couldn‚Äôt be convicted. And then they implemented the rule with his name.
[12/14/19, 6:48:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: But that‚Äôs not it. The best/worst part of it was that then _he_ got murdered and the guy who murdered him was read the Miranda rights.
[12/14/19, 6:48:48 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs just... poetic.
[12/14/19, 6:56:13 PM] Luc: I knew this!
[12/14/19, 6:56:17 PM] Luc: Do you believe me?
[12/14/19, 6:56:32 PM] Luc: Well the first half
[12/14/19, 6:56:43 PM] Luc: The second half is a critical dato
[12/14/19, 6:57:57 PM] Anita Zuddio: Of course I do
[12/14/19, 6:58:46 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt know the end of the story tho. It‚Äôs not funny.. but it is.
[12/14/19, 7:01:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: By would I learn the stages of criminal procedure when I can be reading this side notes, right?
[12/14/19, 7:02:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: Now I‚Äôll tackle the serious stuff.
[12/14/19, 7:02:40 PM] Luc: Good luck üò¨üò¨
[12/14/19, 7:03:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh, wait. One more fun fact.
[12/14/19, 7:05:28 PM] Anita Zuddio: Guess which is one of the few states that does not require unanimous jury veredicts in criminal cases?
[12/14/19, 7:09:04 PM] Luc: Somewhere in the south likely Florida
[12/14/19, 7:09:15 PM] Luc: Piece of shit state that it is üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[12/14/19, 7:09:21 PM] Luc: üôäüôäüôä
[12/14/19, 7:09:24 PM] Luc: Salty today I am
[12/14/19, 7:09:43 PM] Anita Zuddio: hahahahaha
[12/14/19, 7:09:52 PM] Anita Zuddio: And Yoda today you are
[12/14/19, 7:10:13 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oregon actually.
[12/14/19, 7:10:27 PM] Anita Zuddio: (You didn‚Äôt see that coming)
[12/14/19, 7:10:28 PM] Luc: WOW
[12/14/19, 7:10:38 PM] Luc: world View crumbling
[12/14/19, 7:10:40 PM] Luc: Good.
[12/14/19, 7:10:46 PM] Luc: Lets GET those criminals
[12/14/19, 7:11:06 PM] Anita Zuddio: Louisiana and Arizona as well, but we don‚Äôt care.
[12/14/19, 7:11:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahah
[12/14/19, 7:20:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve just decided which way I wanna go on my road trip across the US. Please let‚Äôs talk about it later. üòÅ
[12/14/19, 7:28:05 PM] Luc: Which way is that?
[12/14/19, 7:31:59 PM] Anita Zuddio: From Chicago all the way down to New Orleans.
[12/14/19, 7:32:09 PM] Luc: What?!?!
[12/14/19, 7:32:18 PM] Luc: Oh Ani Ani Ani
[12/14/19, 7:32:29 PM] Luc: Why?
[12/14/19, 7:33:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: Why not?
[12/14/19, 7:33:20 PM] Luc: Because opportunity cost
[12/14/19, 7:37:03 PM] Luc: Here in simple terms
[12/14/19, 7:37:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: Bear in mind that the west coast is my first plan whenever I get to go back.
[12/14/19, 7:37:23 PM] Luc: a. Miles of flat corn and soy fields followed by a stunning level of racism
[12/14/19, 7:37:41 PM] Luc: b. Educated, international people and the most beautiful coastline in the world
[12/14/19, 7:38:00 PM] Luc: I'm salty today
[12/14/19, 7:38:02 PM] Luc: I already said so
[12/14/19, 7:38:05 PM] Luc: hahahah
[12/14/19, 7:38:09 PM] Luc: So I'm gonna bash my people a bit
[12/14/19, 7:38:26 PM] Luc: NO should be, is a very cool city
[12/14/19, 7:38:48 PM] Luc: But only 16 years ago it was the site of a huge hurricane which essentially exposed some very ugly truths
[12/14/19, 7:38:54 PM] Luc: about the structural racism present in the city
[12/14/19, 7:39:01 PM] Luc: and those aspects have unfortunately _not_ improved
[12/14/19, 7:43:26 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs been 16 years from Katrina already? Crap.
[12/14/19, 7:45:27 PM] Luc: yeah
[12/14/19, 7:45:32 PM] Luc: 2001 was nice a good year
[12/14/19, 7:45:35 PM] Luc: nor was 2003
[12/14/19, 7:45:38 PM] Luc: we started a war
[12/14/19, 7:45:43 PM] Luc: and a hurricane owned us
[12/14/19, 7:48:10 PM] Anita Zuddio: So, this is what I was thinking.. I will probably do some parts of the west coast with my cousin soon. We said that it would be our next trip after Colombia (whenever that is). But at the same time, for a road trip, I‚Äôd like to go somewhere.. off the beaten track. And I have no clue of what I would find in between Chicago and NO to be honest. And those are two cities that I would like to visits as well.
[12/14/19, 7:51:00 PM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt know if I was clear. But that would be the idea. Two cities I‚Äôve never visited and a huge mystery in between haha.
[12/14/19, 7:52:09 PM] Luc: Totally clear
[12/14/19, 7:52:21 PM] Luc: I'm just not sure you're gonna find the mystery inbetween so rewarding
[12/14/19, 7:52:26 PM] Luc: but actually it's not a bad roadtrip
[12/14/19, 7:52:29 PM] Luc: maybe you could see the ozarks
[12/14/19, 7:52:37 PM] Luc: watch a hog race
[12/14/19, 7:52:43 PM] Luc: see the headquarters of walmart
[12/14/19, 7:52:48 PM] Luc: you know, _culture_!
[12/14/19, 7:53:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: No idea how did I get from arrest and indictments to New Orleans. My brain is amazing(ly weird).
‚Äé[12/14/19, 7:53:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: ‚Äésticker omitted
[12/14/19, 7:54:19 PM] Luc: good question, I don't know either hahaha
[12/14/19, 8:22:03 PM] Anita Zuddio: At what time are you having your despedida?
[12/14/19, 8:23:00 PM] Luc: 9:30/10!
[12/14/19, 8:23:13 PM] Luc: But a bit far like
[12/14/19, 8:24:27 PM] Luc: Mataderos
[12/14/19, 8:24:36 PM] Luc: Liniers
[12/14/19, 8:26:08 PM] Anita Zuddio: Uh. Deep CABA.
[12/14/19, 9:18:30 PM] Luc: Deeeeep
[12/14/19, 9:21:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: üò∞
[12/14/19, 9:22:47 PM] Anita Zuddio: Well, have a great despedida! ‚ò∫
[12/14/19, 9:37:45 PM] Luc: Thank you
[12/14/19, 9:37:53 PM] Luc: Study night staying in?
[12/14/19, 9:37:59 PM] Luc: Should be an early night for me
[12/14/19, 9:39:41 PM] Anita Zuddio: Yeap. I‚Äôll probably read a while longer and then head to bed so I can wake up early tomorrow.
[12/14/19, 9:39:50 PM] Anita Zuddio: *should*
[12/14/19, 9:40:18 PM] Luc: Nah these friends never sale hard
[12/14/19, 9:40:28 PM] Luc: And I'm impressionable
[12/14/19, 9:40:49 PM] Anita Zuddio: I didn‚Äôt get this
[12/14/19, 9:43:15 PM] Luc: Like I tend to take on the vibe of those around me
[12/14/19, 9:43:26 PM] Luc: So if they're high energy I will be to and vice versa
[12/14/19, 9:43:46 PM] Luc: Everyone is to some extent but I think me a bit more than average
[12/14/19, 9:45:58 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ohhh okay, now I got it.
[12/14/19, 9:49:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôll let you enjoy your night then.

[12/15/19, 8:17:08 PM] Luc: Me lleg√≥ la depre
[12/15/19, 8:18:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ac√° estuve lidiando con mi Nicol√°s (el vecino de arriba). Tuve que ir a tocarle el timbre y por supuesto que no baj√≥ la m√∫sica. Eso m√°s los nervios, ah√≠ nom√°s del llanto.

[12/16/19, 8:11:17 AM] Anita Zuddio: Just here to wish you a great last day in town.
[12/16/19, 8:11:17 AM] Luc: Hello!
[12/16/19, 8:11:28 AM] Luc: Thank you :)
[12/16/19, 8:16:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: ‚ò∫
[12/16/19, 8:16:55 AM] Luc: Do you have an exam today?
[12/16/19, 8:17:06 AM] Luc: I thought I remembered that you did
[12/16/19, 8:17:12 AM] Luc: If so, good luck!!
[12/16/19, 8:17:26 AM] Anita Zuddio: I do
[12/16/19, 8:17:31 AM] Anita Zuddio: In the afternoon
[12/16/19, 8:17:40 AM] Anita Zuddio: Thanks (:
[12/16/19, 8:18:27 AM] Anita Zuddio: At what time does your plane leave?
[12/16/19, 8:19:27 AM] Luc: 22:30
[12/16/19, 8:22:23 AM] Anita Zuddio: Great! Night flight
[12/16/19, 8:30:57 AM] Anita Zuddio: Ani‚Äôs poor _chamuyito_ alert.
[12/16/19, 8:33:38 AM] Anita Zuddio: I wish we‚Äôd had one last dinner/El Marginal/location guessing game night before your departure. I kinda lost you this week. :(
[12/16/19, 8:33:45 AM] Anita Zuddio: But I know you had pleeenty of things to do. And milanesas Sunday was really good anyway, so I‚Äôll do with that one.
[12/16/19, 8:34:29 AM] Luc: I feel like that's decidedly not a chamuyito (?)
[12/16/19, 8:35:04 AM] Luc: Some things are going on with my sister and my head has been out of Argentina already since about Wednesday
[12/16/19, 8:35:05 AM] Anita Zuddio: Wait, that wasn‚Äôt it
[12/16/19, 8:36:02 AM] Luc: So I fulfilled my obligations this weekend but actually I was pretty happy to have some time to myself
[12/16/19, 8:36:11 AM] Luc: I'm sorry about that
[12/16/19, 8:37:09 AM] Anita Zuddio: Hey, no, wait. Nothing to apologize.
[12/16/19, 8:38:16 AM] Anita Zuddio: The ending of what I was saying was that I‚Äôm good at goodbyes but I‚Äôm also good at welcome back plans, and I have some days to make a good one, so that (I) will be waiting for you when you are back.
[12/16/19, 8:40:43 AM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm sorry to read that. But you‚Äôll be there for her in just a few hours. That‚Äôs good I guess. It must not be nice to be so far away when that happens.
[12/16/19, 8:42:28 AM] Anita Zuddio: Okay, that didn‚Äôt come out as I expected. It was supposed to be sweet, not to sound like a whining kid. Hope you get it.
[12/16/19, 8:42:53 AM] Luc: Absolutely
[12/16/19, 8:43:01 AM] Luc: There was no whining kid
[12/16/19, 8:43:36 AM] Luc: Closer to my return (which I still have yet to book) we can take a look, alright?
[12/16/19, 8:43:59 AM] Luc: It would be difficult for me to plan now
[12/16/19, 8:44:33 AM] Anita Zuddio: Forget about it. We can do that when you are already here.
[12/16/19, 8:46:11 AM] Anita Zuddio: Same here. I haven‚Äôt been able to plan my graduation celebration and it‚Äôs in 3 days (if everything comes out alright).
[12/16/19, 12:59:14 PM] Anita Zuddio: Whenever you have a minute.. I think you are gonna enjoy this just as much as I did üòÇ (not sure if it‚Äôs an open account tho).

[12/16/19, 1:37:11 PM] Anita Zuddio: It‚Äôs one of the best ones üòÇ

[12/16/19, 1:39:39 PM] Luc: _so_ Oregon
[12/16/19, 1:40:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh my god. I really need to do that.
[12/16/19, 1:41:02 PM] Luc: They have not changed the logo or the packaging as far as I can remember during my life time
[12/16/19, 1:41:17 PM] Luc: I'll probably eat sea salt and vinegar kettle chips as my final meal
[12/16/19, 1:44:18 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm not sure how long ago did they start to sell them here. But not that long. I mean, I don‚Äôt remember seeing them when I was little (now they are so trendy). We used to have Frenchitas more than anything (now Lays, I remember hating the day they changed their name, it was brilliant).
[12/16/19, 1:45:22 PM] Anita Zuddio: Final meal sounds quite dramatic haha
[12/16/19, 1:46:00 PM] Luc: I haven't seen them here
[12/16/19, 1:46:22 PM] Luc: But they might import from Britain rather than from the USA
[12/16/19, 1:46:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Why is that?
[12/16/19, 1:47:21 PM] Anita Zuddio: They sell them in fancy beer shops and some other shops. Not in the supermarket, as far as I know.
[12/16/19, 1:48:54 PM] Luc: They have another factory in Britain, I have seen them in Brazil and they're the British ones and they're not certified which annoys me
[12/16/19, 1:49:02 PM] Luc: Because at some level I feel that they are _my_ product
[12/16/19, 1:49:09 PM] Luc: they come from _my_ state
[12/16/19, 1:49:20 PM] Luc: I don't want the greasy brits to co-opt them
[12/16/19, 1:49:36 PM] Luc: And make gross flavors like Used Bathwater
[12/16/19, 1:49:46 PM] Luc: or British Morning Breath
[12/16/19, 1:50:06 PM] Luc: or Bubonic Plague
[12/16/19, 1:50:07 PM] Anita Zuddio: Ok. SALTY Luc makes soooo much sense right now.
[12/16/19, 1:50:29 PM] Anita Zuddio: Hahahahaha
[12/16/19, 1:50:39 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôm laughing hard
[12/16/19, 1:50:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Thank you for that
[12/16/19, 1:55:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Come on, this was a good one. üëÜüèºüôÑ
[12/16/19, 1:59:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äòve told you this already, but one of the reasons why I‚Äôd like to spend Christmas in the States some day is because it seems MUCH more fun to celebrate it during the winter.
[12/16/19, 2:00:33 PM] Anita Zuddio: Apart from the food.. You get to wear the cool sweaters!!
[12/16/19, 2:02:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: I‚Äôve just found one with these tiny F1 cars and Christmas trees. It‚Äôs just the most Ani thing I‚Äôve ever seen!! üòç
[12/16/19, 2:02:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: (But it makes no sense to wear that in July ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ)
[12/16/19, 2:28:21 PM] Luc: Hey, is there a Spanish word for bubblewrap?
[12/16/19, 2:29:30 PM] Anita Zuddio: Mmm not really. Es el envoltorio con burbujas.
[12/16/19, 3:04:07 PM] Luc: Gonna bring home a bottle of the Domingo Molina
[12/16/19, 3:05:16 PM] Anita Zuddio: Oh that was _good_
[12/16/19, 3:06:54 PM] Anita Zuddio: Heading to university as we speak. I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how nervous I am.
[12/16/19, 3:07:15 PM] Luc: What will be will be

[12/16/19, 3:24:45 PM] Luc: Nup
[12/16/19, 3:25:44 PM] Anita Zuddio: Are you taking any alfajores or sth like that as well?
[12/16/19, 3:26:19 PM] Anita Zuddio: (Fatty Ani here thinks that you should..)
[12/16/19, 3:28:35 PM] Luc: My family never really eats them
[12/16/19, 3:28:42 PM] Luc: Not sure if you're aware but
[12/16/19, 3:28:51 PM] Luc: The Argentine tolerance to sweetness is very high
[12/16/19, 3:29:05 PM] Luc: The first time I ate an alfajor I found it rather disgusting, truly
[12/16/19, 3:29:13 PM] Luc: It took a while to adjust
[12/16/19, 3:52:34 PM] Anita Zuddio: But but but

[12/17/19, 11:29:09 AM] Luc: no s√© si entiendo el nuevo impuesto propuesto
[12/17/19, 11:29:26 AM] Luc: si compro algo usando mi tarjeta extranjera, aplica?
[12/17/19, 11:29:38 AM] Luc: o es solamente si compro algo del exterior (netflix, lo que sea)
[12/17/19, 11:30:06 AM] Luc: no s√© si aplica al comprador o al vendedor, digo, y no s√© como lo van a enforzar
[12/17/19, 11:31:36 AM] Anita Zuddio: Enforce? Ejecutarlo.
[12/17/19, 11:32:02 AM] Anita Zuddio: Todav√≠a estoy leyendo sobre el impuesto a la compra de d√≥lares para atesoramiento. PORQUE ESTABA POR COMPRAR.
[12/17/19, 11:32:05 AM] Anita Zuddio: Dame un toque
[12/17/19, 11:39:21 AM] Luc: Daale
[12/17/19, 12:01:20 PM] Anita Zuddio: Se supone que el impuesto se aplica cuando te convierten a pesos los gastos
[12/17/19, 12:01:55 PM] Anita Zuddio: Si compras con la extranjera y pagas en dls, osea, nunca pasa a pesos, no deber√≠a aplicar
[12/17/19, 12:03:08 PM] Luc: ugh
[12/17/19, 12:03:17 PM] Luc: pero en ese caso mi banco decide la cotizacion
[12/17/19, 12:03:29 PM] Luc: o no _mi_ banco
[12/17/19, 12:03:34 PM] Luc: el banco que procesa el pago

[12/17/19, 12:10:05 PM] Anita Zuddio: Jajajajaja
[12/17/19, 12:11:01 PM] Anita Zuddio: El impuesto es para ‚Äúrecuperar‚Äù lo que se pierde de divisas del Banco Central cuando pagan los gastos de tarjeta. T√©cnicamente si tu banco est√° afuera no hay p√©rdida para el central. Por lo que no deber√≠a aplicar.
[12/17/19, 12:11:56 PM] Anita Zuddio: PERO te lo est√° diciendo una humilde trabajadora, habr√≠a que chequearlo.

[12/17/19, 12:50:45 PM] Anita Zuddio: No, llegar llego seguro. Sino desde un principio no sacaba el viaje. Pero no me gusta quedar ajustada de ahorros.
[12/17/19, 12:50:53 PM] Anita Zuddio: Y eso seguramente pase
